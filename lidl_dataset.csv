1,"WORKED TO THE BONE
Ask an employee here where to find such and such an item and they will point in the general direction then again put on their head pieces and get back to their shelf packing for their master's over in Europe..
.I'm not finding fault with the workers as they are worked to the bone, and watched for slacking off, in order to keep prices low, bring many customers and so make fat profits but customer care is definitely lacking here.... Maybe it's better to pay more at another store rather than suffer this impersonalism",Lidl
2,I did shop here regularly and during my mnay visits it came to my attention how rude and dismissive the manager of this store is towards other staff members and sometimes customers. It has led me to avoid shopping here and I have begun to choose Aldi instead.,Lidl
3,"I like having Lidl close to my house, but the management here is not the best: Queues are always long and boring and this it's happening since they open this new shop. And the prices are not always the same with what you see when you take the product from shelves, I paid even 3 euro more for a product, when I did complain about it the people working in there didn't care, didn't change the prices and I'm very sure after this other people was screwd like I was. Other problem is when I go to pick up fruits, I don't have plastic bags to put the fruits in it. I don't blame the employees wich they always busy working, but the poor management trying to make money over customer care.",Lidl
4,My wife‚Äôs boyfriend told me about this store and he‚Äôs right it‚Äôs great.,Lidl
5,"This has to be one of the worse Lidl's I've used to date. How it's not been addressed is totally crazy. It's meant to target the lunchtime customer but you'd come back late for work if you ""popin"" here. A quick purchase will take 10 plus minutes. It's so under staffed it could be labeled a sweatshop by international standard's. Infact it's the hard work done by the staff that keeps the shop moving.
It's clear by the mess it's in that the management should be reviewed and renewed.
But don't take my word for it. Popin sometime and grab yourself a lunch. Just make sure you've got an extra long lunch break.
Pay attention to the poorly stocked shelves as the staff are all hands on deck trying to deal with the customers. After you've picked out a lunch. Try and pay. You'll have to enter into a game best know as Q roulette. No one knows what Q to get into and they just jump and swap without warning. Good luck if you get a fast moving one.
If you wait and get to a cashier. Your game is over, however if you go self service don't expect it to end so quickly. Time after time the scanner won't scan the lidl app. This ends up having to make people enter the barcode manually and guess what, they enter it incorrectly and get to have another go.
Great success üëçüëç

Maybe in the new year the manager will be sacked and a new manager with a strong customer focus, will take over.
Tesco is across the road. It's not as good as lidl but you can get served

Update it's still a kip. Poorly ran but it's so easy to just pocket whatever you want. It's blatant and no one does anything about it. The staff are up to their eyes. The guard can't see anything because the lines are filling almost a third of the store. If they had a better manager they'd run it better. Maybe get 4 more self scans would be a start",Lidl
6,It is a very good supermarket with good prices and service‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,Lidl
7,Nothing but empty shelves :( I came in for steak and smoked salmon but there was none . Long queues too . Cop the F on,Lidl
8,Decent shop. I would remove a star due to card only payments at self checkouts.,Lidl
9,"The store itself is nice and the location is good, the staff is mostly nice too, but there is one exception. One of the managers, a woman in her 25-30s, behaves in an arrogant, rude and unprofessional manner. If the client reproached her for lying and photographed the proof of her lie, then she immediately declares that the client is rude, that is, she has the right to lie to the client, and the client, in her opinion, should ignore her lies. It is normal for her to make racist comments and lie to clients not only on her own behalf, but also on behalf of her colleagues - my personal experience with her.
It is sad that such a woman was put in the position of manager. If the manager declares that she is obliged to strictly comply with the store policy, but at the same time she tells me - if the client is nice to me, then I will violate the store policy for him. Then the question is, what are the internal rules of the store for her and how many times does she violate for people or colleagues ""cute"" for her? How competent she is is a question for those who evaluated her professional qualities by offering her the position of a manager. I was forced to write a complaint against her for the second time.",Lidl
10,Great selection of products and queues are very quick with helpful staff if required,Lidl
11,All self-checkout tills are only available for card payments and only one till is open for cash payments which makes crazy queues. Please make some self-checkout tills available for cash payments!,Lidl
12,"Awful shop. The manager doesn't even deserve to be a bin man.

Free üáµüá∏ ‚Ä¶",Lidl
13,"Large store! Well organised! Fresh bakery my favourite! Fresh sourdough bread - brown and white -  very good, acceptable price.",Lidl
14,"Easy to get to from my hotel the moxy. Had the simple things needed as a traveler. Water, coke, shaving needs. Didn't find the sprite. Refer near the door got both sparkling and still water. Check out Lines are full but move fast.
Been warned by our bus driver about pickpockets in the area. So be aware.",Lidl
15,Probably the best Lidl in Dublin. Always great quality fruit and veg and all displays always kept in great order. Credit to the hardworking staff and management.,Lidl
16,"Always overcrowded.  Some shelves are empty. Find something for free from Lidl plus app is rather a miracle.
But generally, great products and competitive prices. I've visited different Lidl branches ,including one from my previous area at the Dundrum. Talbot Street is the most hopeless and needs a new management.",Lidl
17,Awful shop. Terrible manager.,Lidl
18,"What a mess this place is, I think there is 8 self check outs & today 1 was not working & 4 had red light where there was faults on them. Meanwhile people queuing waiting on staff to clear the faults. The tills are so bad they need a member of staff at the tills all day. Jesus update your system you can well afford it. What a mess Lidl.",Lidl
19,"One of the most hardworking crews, because they are putting up with customer complaints and working for a probably useless management.

They only keep one cashier and 2 self check outs open leading to a queue of about 50 or more customers. In this scenario I have to wait half an hour before I can pay for a single commodity and be on my way.

Very bad service on these lines. Everyday scenario.",Lidl
20,"They deserve one star just because there‚Äôs a self service checkout which makes queues to move faster than in other Lidl branches, otherwise there‚Äôs nothing good to comment about. Customer service is appalling, store assistants extremely rude, texting on their phones while serving the customers and chatting among themselves, stock is always missing on the shelves, few times found expired products on the shelves. When asking for help anyone on the floor, they don‚Äôt show much interest in helping you out. Store managers should be seriously concerned about who they‚Äôre hiring for a job, simple manners in dealing with the customers would be a good start.",Lidl
21,"The queue management is the absolute worst I have seen in any supermarket ever. They are always short on staff, they have 3 or 4 checkout counters with staff but only one is open during rush hour. The self checkout stations are super slow and there are always 2 or 3 that are out of service. Who ever thought of this system should be fired.",Lidl
22,"Super busy Lidl, always long queue at self and chasier checkouts. Products are mostly finished fast. It‚Äôs super convenient that it‚Äôs city center but brings crowds",Lidl
23,Deceptive Mispricing on the shelves. Always worth double checking at the till. The lady sorted it out of but that's not the point. Most people are too busy to query. Don't get me started on Lidl plusüòÄ ‚Ä¶,Lidl
24,"I love Lidl if you want cheap groceries with the best products,  Lidl would be the best the one supermarket where you can buy food ,drinks and they even sell household product ,clothing anything you need ,For me Its the only shop in ireland where I dont have to worry about for example is this going to taste good when I eat it or having fear of getting food poisoning,  and last thing I want to say is that the employees in Lidl Talbot Street  aren't really friendly but I dont blame cause the shop is always full of people and its always busy  but I want to wish all the lidl employees to stay strong you guys are doing a great job",Lidl
25,"Horrible experience. More than 30 min to be able to pay since the queue started. Self-service checkouts are horrible, you have to call the Lidl worker for absolutely everything, there is only one poor worker who can't handle everything. To buy a bottle of wine, 5 min to come, to apply 30% to a discounted product, 5 min to come. To apply a coupon, 5 min. More than 15 minutes waiting for the worker who was running to come because she couldn't do more. And then they give you discounts in the store that do NOT apply to you at the checkout. Two things have been charged much more expensive than what was stated in the store but I was already embarrassed to have to call the worker again and I was not willing to spend even 1 more minute there. I had to pay more to be able to leave. I WILL NOT COME BACK. You have a Tesco in front and an Aldi 10 min walk.",Lidl
26,Not bad for a Lidl in City centre. This branch is clean and the queues are fast. Like always the only problem is the lack of customer assistance around the place.,Lidl
27,"too many rude and useless staff, i guess i have to pay them so they move out if my way. Asking them nicely doesn't work, not that i found any of them speaking English.",Lidl
28,"Fresh baked breads are good, there are few items which are available at very affordable prices. I like roasted bell peppers and butter crossoint a lot",Lidl
29,"Always busy,Always waiting in lineüòë ‚Ä¶",Lidl
30,Huge queues at 6pm weekdays,Lidl
31,"The queues are too long and move way too slow. Shopping at lidl in general is a stressful ordeal. Stores are too small, long queues, run over by cages, staff in the way. Give the extra ‚Ç¨5 in total & go to tesco. Less irritating.",Lidl
32,"Talbot Street, clean shop , pleasant staff, good offers, interesting items for sale both food and non food items.  Christmas items are starting to creep into stocks, for anyone trying to stock ahead",Lidl
33,You had some products stolen today at 17:20 approximately,Lidl
34,All self-checkout tills are only available for card payments and only one till is open for cash payments which makes crazy queues. Please make some self-checkout tills available for cash payments!,Lidl
35,"very full and with little supervision, there was a guy taking all the bread with the extra ones and putting them back in their place.",Lidl
36,"Good Shop, well organised, fortunately there is self checkout which makes it pretty faster. Little bit of more space would be great.",Lidl
37,"Nice new shop in city centre, you can find everything for good price. Self service check out are cool, just need time for people to learn how to use it",Lidl
38,"Great staff and super savings on shopping DIY , gardening and lots more",Lidl
39,"Girl at the self service was soo rude, all I‚Äôve asked was can I please have a bag , if she could have she would have slap me on my face with it !!! I get it it‚Äôs busy but how is it any of this my fault ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚Ä¶",Lidl
40,The worst market I've ever entered in Ireland. Opening the doors to provide a bad service is better to stay closed. I will never enter this market again and I don't recommend it to anyone.,Lidl
41,Worst quality check in Lidl,Lidl
42,Horrible like all Lidls around city centre. Counters are dirty and that's the place where you have to put your items after you scan them.,Lidl
43,Very covid aware. Nice bright and big place. You can get all your groceries in one place. Plenty of bus stops outside.,Lidl
44,"Every time I'm here, baskets are super gross. Today also frozen food waiting long time outside of the freezer.",Lidl
45,"Lidl is the best shop here for me. They have good kinds of fruits, foods, many different kinds of coffees and teas and the most important is they have a good price.",Lidl
46,Aisles were poorly displayed hard to find things.needs some more oganising. Products left on trollies in narrow aisles that sort of thing sorry but that was my experience.,Lidl
47,Here are the handbags. I love you for it!!!,Lidl
48,"Cashier very helpful in how a technophobe! üòÄ Deals with the +App.
Great Value on energy drinks too ‚Ä¶",Lidl
49,It's a great store! Shopping after 6 will lead you to empty shelves.,Lidl
50,Try to avoid this branch because it's always overcrowded and not enough staff for this volume of people,Lidl
51,üëç very nice store where you can find everything for less price and good quality ‚Ä¶,Lidl
52,Great new shop in Talbot street. You get all what you need at this lidl. Including brownies in small bites which are my favourite ones,Lidl

61,"Great place just dodgy area, machines for self checkout waste time",Lidl
62,"no one respects the queue, many people steal",Lidl
63,"Prices are awesome, just not many supplies to the same item.",Lidl
64,Floor security and the girl on self service saying they would love to punch customers around vile carry on asked the security how to get past the metal gate to get to the til and no even answered rude and unprofessional,Lidl

138,Super Lidl well located not too far from the city center. Good prices and wide choice of products as in all Lidl. Very quick checkout given the number of boxes,Lidl
139,A rather large Lidl for a city center. Not very modern but we find the qualities of Lidl: lots of choice and low prices. The only complaint is that there are a lot of problems at the self-checkouts. The queues at the checkouts are therefore long.,Lidl
140,"This Lidl, despite being very busy, I think they restock more and have more options",Lidl
141,"Lidl is one of the best markets in Dublin to do your shopping, it always has several promotions and good prices, one of the only places we can buy frozen chicken breast fillet, the market's bakery is great, it has different types of bread, donuts , croissants and other sweets, has a wide variety of products, the only problem is that there is usually a long queue when paying for purchases.",Lidl
142,I was very happy to have a familiar supermarket around the corner. Friendly staff and lots of varied offers. I just thought it was a shame for the cashiers that they had to stand at the checkouts!,Lidl

1,"I applied for a job here, the interviewers wasn‚Äôt good, they ask me two questions at once and had to ask them to repeat one them. It completely took me out my form  , pawel said something about being late, I wasn‚Äôt late. There was 2 people ahead me I presume the same time and yes they weren‚Äôt Irish.   Shane was nice, the other pawel , I didn‚Äôt like,  definitely racism going on here and felt discriminated. I walked in and it‚Äôs all foreigners working there. Not one Irish person in sight. Pure disgrace and sick to my stomach about the racism going on in my own country born and rised here and can‚Äôt get a job because a foreign wants his own people to work here. Discrimination",Lidl
2,Watch out for products on special offers... Very often prices at checkout are different then on the shelf. Last time they tried to charge me 17.99 for working trousers but they suppose to be on sale for 10.99...,Lidl
3,"On the plus, modern and quick self-check out. Downside many times fresh items poorly stocked. If I've a large shop I go to Aldi across the road they're better stocked, this shop is fine if I need a small quick shop.",Lidl

5,"Lidl plus is close to being a scam.

Display discounted price, tiny Lidl plus sign on the product label, then you have to activate the offer on the app to get the discounted price

Why the offer activation nonsense?",Lidl
6,Experienced an ignorant and rude staff member today at the self checkout. Really disappointed. Manager Slywia stood around and allowed it happens and wasn't interested in listening to my points. Is this how you guys operate now?,Lidl
7,Queue was maddness and staff were extremely slow coping. Poorly run should have standby resources available for busy times,Lidl

10,"Been shopping here since day 1 it opened.

I've never taken a receipt once.

I was in there Friday paid for my shopping with cash.

My wife is away so I sent my son in to change the chicken that was out of date 6 days I just bought the day before.

He told my son he needs a receipt. Which I understand

I've now got 4 kids in the car outside.
2 with special needs.

The staff see me in there at least 3 times a week.

I can't Change you need receipt or the card you paid with.
I paid with cash that day.

I spent at least 250 euros a week in this shop.

I won't be going back again.

Absolute dummies
Hire more people that have the ability to remember a face.

Big fuss about 8 euro.

Not sorry we sold you gone of chicken by a week.

Don't ask people do they want a receipt
Just give it to them regardl",Lidl
11,"When I come to shop here. Got everything I need. One asian lady Thai was very friendly, NICE.  all staff helpful, good experience.",Lidl
12,"Really rude staff. I went to self-scan because there was only one till open, despite the shop being busy.

One of my items weighed wrongly, and the staff member came over in a huff, picked the item up, increased the price and threw it back down. All without a word.

I'm guessing that I scanned the wrong bread or something, but it was really rude behaviour, a normal person would have just pointed out it was wrong.

Then usually, the tills are not open, and often staff partially block up asiles when they're restocking (like they will block it up, and some person with a trolley will park beside them and then you can't get by. Generally, staff are not helpful",Lidl

As a loyalty customer, I had an extremely bad shopping experience in East wall Lidl !!!! Very disappointed !!!!",Lidl

17,"we bought a cheese for confusion and when we checked the ticket (inside the store and next to the cashier) it was more expensive than what we wanted, so we tries to change it and they said no because it was outside the fridge and someone can get sick.

19,"My first stop destination for daily grocery shopping.
The place is usually occupied with people.
There are offers keeps on coming every week.
Also you get few products free using scratch card in the Lidl Plus app.
I personally find Lidl better than Tesco and Aldi in terms of both looks and product availability.",Lidl
20,"You can find main products at good prices at Lidl : vegetables, fruits, yoghurts, cheese, meat and fishes, bread and cakes, coffee ant tea,  grocery, drugstore...",Lidl
21,Car Park is like a rubbish skip. Entrance & lobbies is no better. Either they have had a load of trolleys taken or their just not bothered to have a staff member collected them. If your lucky you will manage to fill half your shopping list as there are a lot of regular items missing or out of stock. Finally would it hurt to open an extra couple of check outs when the que is half way down the store.,Lidl
22,Best variety of goods I have ever seen in Lidl.,Lidl
23,"Worst place to shop this day.

The staff never restocked the vegetables. All empty any day of the week.They prefer to put it out on sale when is almost rotten.

The prices have been duplicated from before but the salaries for their employees is still the same.

I am shopping elsewhere these days. Even tesco has better value prices.

Such of shame. Hope they shut down.

There should be a law to make the restock the vegetables.

When you go to any lidl all is finished since the morning. Specially this one. that way you buy some othe products They want to sell.

Exp basmati rice.",Lidl
24,Terrible experience today in your shop ...no kindness displayed by any of the staff .only one till open ..no body around to help customers in self service .area going down hill rapid.,Lidl

26,Great selection. Great opening hours. Friendly staff. Great prices. Convenient location.,Lidl
27,"Excellent value. Look for specials - it may be your lucky day. Fresh produce - fruit and vegetables. Lovely items from their in-house bakery. Save when you are ready to do a major shopping expedition. However, don't expect to find everything on your list. Couldn't find strong or bread flour.",Lidl
28,"Well stocked shelves and clean and tidy,sadly no check outs open üò∫ nly self  check outs open .these are terrible as they are managements way of reducing staff,also can be very difficult for many walks of life to use such as oap's , especially if they have items that don't have barcodes such as having to weigh items or bakery items no staff present to ask to open a check out so had to use self check out.so to sustain jobs ,if check outs are open please use them .",Lidl
29,Great store. Well stocked and also has self serve checkouts for those just buying a few things quickly. Nice to have the free EV charge point also!,Lidl
30,"Good quality products, the cheapest supermarket prices in Dublin along with Aldi. Shopping here can be half as expensive as shopping in your regular supermarket. You will notice no difference in terms of quality whatsoever. They also have an app that offers discounts on a weekly basis as well as free products as a reward every time you shop.",Lidl
31,"Yesterday I have bought lots of products for 40+euro. A cashier counted apples as kakies, today I went to the shop and told what happened. They agreed to refund but again, I was needed to explain them prices for apples. No apologies for their mistakes (I'm pretty sure it was a personal cashier dislike).
Now I don't want to go in this supermarket again, especially there is another shop just across the street to spend my money.",Lidl
32,"constant stock issues, some friendly staff some not, I don't know if what I'm about to say is the same of all Lidl's but they stock the same stuff no variety, same stuff all the time makes it worse when they don't have something in stock you know they have been stocking for years.",Lidl
33,Staff so helpful and courteous. Met 2 extremely helpful managers over the Christmas period who dealt with my problems most satisfactorily. Thank you Lidl East Wall,Lidl
34,"Horrible place. I was there last Saturday with my 11 years old daughter. We were served by one of the managers (can't remember his name but he is Croatian), because he was wearing blue shirt. While he was serving us he was constantly talking with another manager, which was on another checkout opposite him. He's every second ward was Fu...king, can't believe in front of the custumer with a child every second ward Fu...king. I will never again step into this horrible place. I know that Lidl's have very poor customer service, but the language he was using is shocking.",Lidl
35,"Good store grab nice soups,  cold coffees and to be honest the Sri Lankan chicken soup is the best soup I've tasted.my only complaint is they don't sell jalape√±os for some reason . I would avoid the own brand piri piri sauce... its bad.",Lidl
36,"Shop is quite big. Vegetables, fruits, bakery items are so fresh and quality products. Nice place for day to day shopping. Staff is helpful. Decent amount of parking space.",Lidl
37,"Good, fast and cheap supermarket worth food of all kinds",Lidl
38,"My Personal Favourite Supermarket to shop in! Great Selection. Tasty, quality food for a more than fair price. Pleasant, helpful staff and a lovely calm vibe in the storeüëçüòÉ ‚Ä¶",Lidl
39,"This one will probably get deleted as the previous couple of bad reviews if I'm not mistaken, but anyway: a rather unpleasant experience. Insolent manager, Marko for whatever reason it may be, you don't treat customers that way. As someone with a vast customer service experience, I was appalled by the amount of anger and bad energy directed at us today. Hope you find inner peace and harmony, but I am not going back to this Lidl and I would not recommend it at all.",Lidl
40,Good stuff and you have Aldi in front of if you are not happy enough,Lidl
41,"The Lidl itself is not in bad location My friend and I went to Lidl with the intention to buy a food and since the moment we went inside the staff kept looking at us which made us feel uncomfortable. We understand there are certain rules during the Covid-19 outbreak,  but that's not a reason to treat people as if they were thieves. Both of us left the place feeling bad. Both my friend and I have been working in customer service for over 5 years and we travelled half of Europe and never have we experienced this kind of service.",Lidl
42,"Like the store, not well stocked this evening but a big pity that there was no one available for check out duty. Just before closing so had to use self service - which I avoid when ever possible. Hate seeing self service as this is just a loss of local jobs, particular for young people.",Lidl
43,Whenever I've visited this Lidl it's been well stocked with products and the staff have been helpful and friendly. The range of products is vast and all sold at very reasonable prices. The special offers rotate and are always worth checking out to find bargains. The cashier staff work quickly and even when busy I've never queued more than 15 mins.  Ideal for the weekly groceries!,Lidl
44,"No staff to ask information from, all shelves empty! It‚Äôs was not a good experience! Went to Dunne‚Äôs all staff and stock were there, got ‚Ç¨10 off my ‚Ç¨50, it may have been a bit more expensive but with voucher no difference and a nice shopping experience!",Lidl
45,"I love shopping at Lidl, there's a good selection of different products and always fresh produce. I am a vegan and really appreciate their attention towards supplies for plant based products - snacks, super foods, dairy substitutes (I wish they had something for cheese as well!! ) I also end up buying supplies for my hobbies, like pastry and drawing and other home stuff. Really good price-quality ratio :)",Lidl
46,It's a brand new Lidl so great value groceries and the weekly specials of random items. In store bakery does some really nice breads and pastries. Can be busy and have a bit of a queue at the checkout but you can't argue with the prices.,Lidl
47,"Often visit this Lidl to pick up some bits. Today I noticed fresh baguettes had just come out of the oven, and cooling on the rack. I caught the eye of the baker, who was absolutely lovely and handed me a fresh, warm baguette which made my day.",Lidl
48,"Great store,

Great coffee machine:)

Lidl to go for ‚Ç¨1 is amazing",Lidl
49,"Clamp for standing 1 hour and 32 minutes during major shopping, not recommended",Lidl
50,If the Asian lady was paid to destroy his smile well then LIDL owes me alot of money.,Lidl
51,I'll have to complain about potatoes. Silly thing but I got organic last week and not organic today and in both cases they all black inside. How old are those tatoes who supplies them and does management know what they selling to people I sure will ask nxt time. Other than that clean shop with very nice shop assistants.,Lidl
52,Nice place for shopping ;),Lidl
53,"Meh. It felt like it was a store that didn't care about its service to the community because it was so disheveled: it seems that's always Lidls presentation. This had the least amount of fresh food I've seen in a while (been shopping in Mallow, which has a much better store).  It was all down the one side of the store and the rest of the food was mostly frozen and processed. Plenty of parking, felt marginally safe: not well lit parking area. Next to McDonalds and Starbucks and across from Aldi. Not that familiar with Dublin.",Lidl
54,"Best Lidl that I've visited in Ireland. Bakery is great. And because Aldi was across the road, it made them make their store better also because it was awful before Lidl came. Staff are great. Self check available also so never queuing for long",Lidl
55,Always good value but would prefer loyalty scheme or points per euro spent rather than discounts on products i don't always buy.,Lidl
56,"Well stocked, large Lidl. Lots of parking to the rear (two EV chargers) and bike parking to the front.  The most useful feature is the Aldi directly across the road in case you need anything there.",Lidl
57,"Love this Lidl! Its big, easy to get around and has loads of amazing products! But i am still missing more vegan options! Vegan soy jogurt, vegan spreads or cheeses, pizzas etc would be a great addition finally!",Lidl
58,"Good range of products in various sections, Great value on all the items!",Lidl
59,I had the most ignorant cashier ever. Very rude and she didn‚Äôt know how to process a refund. She refuse to give me my ticket back and made things complicated. I just wanted my money and to leave that horrible place. I love Lidl but it‚Äôs the last time I go to this branch.,Lidl
60,"Good food, great staff, even better prices. Also parking, Starbucks and McDonald's all right beside it. Great shop",Lidl
61,Great value for the weekly shop and the parking is easier to negotiate than ALDI. frustrating that some shoppers abandon their cars near the entrance to the shopping centre however with relative impunity. Fruit and Veg is always pretty fresh. Baskets for going around always in short supply. the Bakery is another advantage it has over ALDI,Lidl
62,Great shop. As always good value to be found. The staff member on the till was extremely pleasant and courteous.,Lidl
63,"Their check out system is crazy. It's the slowest lidl I was ever in, any where in Europe.
They allow customers to pack bags trolleys while the teller waits to get paid  and we wait in line.
When it should be, repack trolleys and baskets after cashier,  then sort them out at the desk provided. It's happening ever since it opened .",Lidl
64,"Would have been better if shop assistants are around customers to easily locate some items. Otherwise, great!",Lidl
65,"Great prices,fresh food and good service. Always a bargain. 5 stars.Tremendous",Lidl
66,It's always my easy way out to get all the stuffs for the rest of the week and that too way cheaper. After shopping here I'd been saving atleast 60 euros every month on groceries,Lidl
67,"I did purchase salads, which aren't out of date yet and been already rotten.
Thats happend not only once but 3 times.
Whole Lidel company is experiencing some problem with freshness of veg.
I won't buy there again.",Lidl
68,"Reviewing Lidl. Ok I was sent to get school shirts for the child by herself. I arrived a day late and all the polo shirts in the boys soze were sold out. If you want one of the special buys go early. If you have never been in Lidl. Then one is pretty much like any other. Cheap, good, groceries and a queue at the till",Lidl
69,"Standard Lidl, somewhat limited range of products at low prices but always excellent quality and amazingly fast checkout; if you have seen one you have seen them all.   Good parking at this site, shared with a fast food franchise.",Lidl
70,"Its just another hypermart for you regular grocery shopping but prices are comparatively lower compared to other competitors in Ireland, making it my first choice. Lidl usually has big stores where you get most of the household stuff. They have both self-checkout and tills. The one on EastWall has good management and I am a regular visitor.",Lidl
71,Lidl is a great place to for everday shopping. Weekends are usually busiest with longer lines outside the store. Early morning shopping at 8am is highly recommend to avoid weekend ques,Lidl
72,Staff always helpful... prices are good value on most items. Ques generally go quickly most of time.,Lidl
73,"This is a larger-scale Lidl supermarket with a wider variety and greater quantity of items, and self-checkout is available.",Lidl
74,"The staff made a mistake of charging me twice and when I pointed it out, instead of apologizing she was showing attitude and wasn't apologetic at all. Her name was Nusara. Not a very pleasant experience.",Lidl
75,Huge supermarket! It has everything I need. Deluxe items and International products available. No queues and kind staff. Clean and organised. Cheap and good quality food! I do recommend!,Lidl
76,its a typical Lidl. its hand as there is another shop across the Road. Plenty of parking but many people park all over the place. It also has a self service till. Good range of food.,Lidl
77,"Unfortunately some staff (transferred or new) have no clue regarding their products. Stocky man about 50 told me they don't sell carbonara sauce in a jar. Insane as I have been buying it for the last 5 years. Pls train the staff to say I don't know, I'll go and ask for you.",Lidl
78,"Good range of products, large selection of fresh vegetables and fruit. Super half price products every weekend. Quick service.",Lidl
79,"Great value for money. Good selection and quality of meat, bread and fruit. Would be great if they had more premium international products .",Lidl
80,"Poor quality in the vegetable section. Stocked out of many items...
The plant section was nice and salmon was good
Poor shopping experience overall",Lidl
81,Great collection at very affordable prices.. Good deals also available and you can get to know upfront by the Lidl app,Lidl
82,Great place with fair price.,Lidl
83,Isn't so crowd and generally the queue takes just some minutes. Thanks,Lidl
84,Great place to shop .everything you would need under one roof  along with exceptional  household deals .,Lidl
85,@East Wall Garden Club would like to thank Ian a manager in Lidl East Wall for outstanding service we received when shopping there Mon 11th Apr ‚Äò22,Lidl

88,"It's a decent store, quality of the food is good, and it's more clean and tidy than other Lidl store I saw around the city (especially the one in Moore St).
I tried to go to the Aldi right in front of this store, but it looks like a cheaper and much more filthier version of this Lidl.",Lidl
89,"Google asls me how was my visit and let me tell you , it was amazing, such a great fun it was i cant describe and i would give higher rating but i cant... ;(",Lidl

93,"Lovely store and plenty of checkouts open the staff member who served me was most pleasant , lovely selection of Christmas foods deluxe range affordable and really nice to eat,",Lidl
94,"The only thing missing in this Supermarket is that you put a price reader because not all merchandise has a price and we have to go to the cashier to find out the price of the merchandise.There you always have a good experience, because Personal are very kind.",Lidl
95,"I had my bicycle stolen next to the store.  Think twice about leaving your bike on the corner next to Lidl and Starbucks as this is a sketchy neighborhood.  A group of thieves frequents the area, so bicycles are left alone even if chained are not safe.",Lidl
96,The one thing that will turn me off using this store is the queues at the checkouts. I don't think I have ever seen the six tills in use. Take a leaf out of Aldi's book and open all the checkouts.,Lidl
97,Nice clean store friendly staff good value and excellent parking,Lidl
98,Very clean. Busy in the afternoon and in the morning there is barely any fresh vegetables.,Lidl
99,Handy shop and well presented. Good quality food too.,Lidl
100,"Stopped by last minute to pick up a birthday cake for a pal's birthday. Staff were very helpful, we got what we needed!",Lidl
101,"I wheel locked my bike inside the entrance of this lidl as the security is always beside the entrance. It was only a minute later when I came out and realised bike was not there. I ask the security man he had no clue. I ran to look for it and later recover it after an assault from teenage gangs around the area. A locked bike was picked up rite under the nose of security, cctv and customers. Every single one failed but now I learned a huge lesson that avoid going to east wall area for good. Thank you lidl",Lidl
102,It was good...but didn't have some of the common essential products. They should do more research on it.,Lidl

120,"Big, bright, good car park. Being right across the road from Aldi makes it handy to hit both places in one trip.",Lidl
121,"Typical LIDL value lovely staff but as an old North Strand East Wall boy I never thought I'd see the day when this area would be up and  coming and don't get me wrong growing up here in the 60's & 70's was special and made me who I am today. Schooled in William street which I loved and Joey's in Fairview which I feared and despise to this very day football in Fairview Park and my first photo with my dad in Fairview Park. Lidl has brought an opportunity a choice to shop less expensively and no compromise on quality we also can enjoy a coffee in  Starbucks or McDonald's gone are the days when you were sent for messages and could buy cigarettes for your mam even a single cigarette for your self  no questions asked. Now we have an circular society, lattes and Pawel is as common as Anto my God my old Christian Brothers would be rolling in their graves. Ireland has grown up and the impact of the likes of Lidl will not be measured by academy on years to come on the positive social impact they have had on new Irish life.",Lidl
122,"Staff are so helpful ,prices and special offers are unbelievable",Lidl

2,"Nice shop , experience ( yesterday Dec 21st) was spoiled by a checkout operator (wearing a Lidl Christmas Jumper) who was obviously suffering from a Cold / Flu constantly having to clear his nose with tissues as he handled customers food items as he passed them through the scanner , it‚Äôs a poor reflection on management that they didn‚Äôt see this as an obvious health hazard, if this is deemed acceptable in a front of house situation I dread to think what the hygiene standards are like elsewhere in the store .
Manager please take your customers health more seriously!",Lidl
3,"Use Lidl in UK and Ireland and this is a great store. Well laid out , great selection and staff much friendlier than my Lidl in UK. As a Drumcondra local originally , streets better than the other supermarket down the road :-) Christmas eve hours were wrong both on the Lidl app and on Google ...it was shut by 6 , not 7",Lidl
4,"Its the price labels, really really all over the place or not there at all. There is no Lidl Ballymun store branch phone number.

I asked a girl for a price on Cien deodorant, as it also had Africa and some other Lynx scent on the SAME label for ‚Ç¨0.89 (EDIT : Getting better, maybe they are reading but not actually acknowledging in here).

I asked one of the floor assistants to help with THEIR problem, not my problem, and was told to queue up to verify, no way, and asked her to do it, as this was ridiculous, she snatched the Lynx out of my hand stormed to the till  saying ""I'll do it then, happy"" came back, Lynx was ‚Ç¨2.50 something, not even acknowledging THEIR complete fault for a customer query and just stormed off, completely unacceptable.

Whether this was deliberate to embarrass people at the tills and buy Lynx, like the old

(Bait and Switch its called in fraud and deceptive practices circles)

I dunno, but the pricing was totally and utterly wrong or make no sense, Rolls for ‚Ç¨0.50 cents each or 4 rolls for ‚Ç¨2.00... Ehhh yeah 4 x ‚Ç¨0.50 is ‚Ç¨2.00 ??? and they aren't sold loose so whats the point of that, in the pies meats cheese wrong labels, wrong places, weights wrong or over the wrong product,

I might get pictures next time I'm over there tomorrow 08 February

BTW, Lidl Drumcondra does not have all these issues  just the rolls, only Ballymun, so its Management and the shelf stackers not taking care that's the issue here IMO, as for mam in her 90's going here, forget it, when she goes here, there were nearly always 2 or 3 things she didnt get because there was the above mentioned issue with pricing labels, or an overcharge but thats usually balanced with an under charge as the prices are SO wrong, kind of ironic and moronic at the same time)",Lidl
5,"Not honouring closing hours. The ""opening hours"" sign says opened until 9pm. However, at 8:50pm they stop letting people in. Would you please change the sign to 8:50pm then?",Lidl

10,"I ventured into the Lidl supermarket, a land of budget-friendly delights, and my journey was a joyous one indeed. The store was clean, and the staff dazzled with their ever-present smiles. However, my trusty shopping cart had a rebellious streak, with a wobbly wheel causing chaos and mischief. So, dear Lidl, might I suggest a valiant quest to replace or swap these renegade carts, making our shopping experience a true 5-star escapade?",Lidl
11,Great store.  Good discounts,Lidl

1st It is close to my apartment (around 1km lol üòÇ) and shopping for a good valueüëçthe only thing is that I was a lil bit lost actually in where could I find what I needed because of the way how they organize and separate the groceries in there. ‚Ä¶",Lidl
15,"NEVER EVER SHOP AT LIDL DRUMCONDRA if you have to go with a car. The parking is tiny and is full 9 times out of 10 ! Today I had to pop in very quickly just for bread and there was only the 2 disable spaces available. I reconned that since I was going to be so fast, if I park in one, what are the odds that in 10 minutes they will be both needed... Well, I wasn't even 7 minutes in and I was clamped straight away. The clamping car was actually still there and had to wait for 20 minutes, while I manage to get somebody on the phone at his company to pay the ‚Ç¨120 euros fine.
The most expensive bread ever!",Lidl
16,"No bags. Barely any staff on the floor to help you. Massive lines at the till every single time you go in. Always only two cashiers on the tills regardless of how many people are in the shop. Lines literally going from the tills half way down the aisles. Deplorable. Never seen a Lidl like it. Go to the small corner shop across the road, you'd honestly be better off!",Lidl
17,"Slightly smaller that other Lidl shops. You may have a little less variety than in other branches.
Bike parking is located inside the car park not in the street and it is limited to 3 racks. A good bunch of car parking spaces although you may need to wait at peak times (only happened to me once). Clamping actively in operation so don't risk parking on the wrong spot",Lidl
18,So disappointed with this store.  Did my shopping there last week and when I came back to my car I was clamped.  Went back into the store and was told nothing to do with them.  I walked out the main car park entrance to watch my child cross the road to an appointment and walked back in to do my shopping but seemingly you are not allowed walk out that way so I was clamped.  Had to pay ‚Ç¨120 extra to release my car after my 25 min shopping trip.  Clamping Co refused my appeal as they say they are a poor private company so my fault as I used the main exit.  Be careful guys!,Lidl
19,"Amazing day in Tayto Park. So much to see and do! Super staff and lots of thrills. Nissan 'driving liscense' was only disappointment, b long queue in a stuffy corridor followed by a 3 min go on the cars and an extra fee to get a printed 'liscense'. Everything else super.",Lidl

24,Really like this Lidl store. Staff are all very helpful and friendly led by the manager Max. Very clean too. Only minus would be a pity that they didn‚Äôt include self service tills like East Wall as it can get very busy sometimes.,Lidl
25,"This Lidl has a weird layout, but there is planning permission that says they're going to change the internal layout a bit. So as of October 2020 the layout is weird, but they're working on it.

The vending machine is nice and the prices are great.

If you don't want to use the escalator, there is a staircase around the corner of it.

Go early in the morning if you want the cheaper food because the students who live in the area tend to buy it all up by lunch time.",Lidl

29,"The car park is really small and tight if don't drive a toy car. The store looked a bit desheveled, quite a few spaces where the things I wanted used to be, similar issue in a few stores recently like Ballymun, finglas & gullivers üôÑ ‚Ä¶",Lidl
30,"Visited Lidl Drumcondra on their opening day, Feb 20, 2020. As you would expect, the shop was spotless. Nicely laid out and lit with the usual range of Lidl stock. The car park is very small and exciting onto the very busy Drumcondra Road will be difficult at times.",Lidl
31,"This is the best Lidl store ever, well stocked with all my favourites, Steaks, Cheeses, fresh vegetables, great range of beers and wines. Very Spacious, and well organized with hand Sanitizers and Tissues, and of course very polite staff. See you there in the wine section.",Lidl
32,"My partner 71 years old just went to your store.
There was no special time range for old people - normally up to 11 - no social distancing at the door. One security guy doing nothing!! So it was packed inside.
What's going on there?
We are expecting an answer. Thanks.",Lidl
33,"Overall a good store.
I just wish the first floor door to get to the elevator and back to it would stay open at all times.
It‚Äôs extremely hard to open the door if you are alone with a buggy!",Lidl
34,"10am on a Sunday, very quite and easy to shop.  Everything I wanted in stock.  Go full Lidl",Lidl
35,Called in this evening at about 2055 not realising that it closed at 2100 until one of the rudest so called security men I have ever encountered started waving his hands saying hurry up hurry we are closing. An elderly man came in after me and he treated him with the same disrespect. A comedy of errors trying to get out into the carpark as the doors to get out were locked. I'll stick with Tesco and by the way this store has made a dreadful traffic situation much much worse. I must say though the people on the tills were lovely.,Lidl
36,"Just home from store now  was very annoyed.to see no paper towels on way in and nobody supervising Q's... guys in particular are not keeping distances and not giving other customers enough space to proceed.     Im very nervous now and no sure if I would feel save going into the store now.  I live locally and visit store 3/4 times weekly

3,"I went to this store over the weekend and I have to say, customer service is absolutely amazing. Had an amazing lad called Michael assist me the best he could. So polite and friendly. Although he had overwhelming customers, he kept a smile on his face and continued to do his work. It‚Äôs an amazing gift to have, being able to do your job whilst under pressure. I‚Äôd recommend this and I hope Michael gets the recognition he deserves.",Lidl

6,"Ridiculous customer service. I wish I could give less than one star.  Today I went there and I got some groceries. After paying I noticed that one of the product  was not sealed and the box was opened. The lady who was working on the till told me to exchange which I tried but  I could not find the same product  and I got a similar one and I told her that I would pay the difference. Then she asked me to queue up again and I did for quite long and when I got there to exchange the product she told that wouldn't be possible.
So incompetent and rude üòí",Lidl
7,I was in the Santry Lidl store recently and I was there for the very first time purchasing my lotto tickets for the weekend and when I handed one of the store assistants the lottery tickets that I purchased he hadn't any idea how to put the tickets through the machine that I purchased as the lottery machines in Lidl are different to the ones that any  newsagents and other supermarkets would have and he had to call over one of his work colleagues to show him how to scan the lottery tickets that I purchased on the machine and I also handed him two tickets that I won 2 free Daily millions Quick Picks on from a previous lotto draw that I did the lotto for and when he did scan one of the tickets that had one of the Daily millions Quick Picks on only one of them printed out for him and the other one didn't print out of the machine for him and then he had to call a work colleague over to his till to serve me as he hadn't an idea how the lottery machines worked and his work colleague wasn't very helpful with dealing with my situation as I demanded that I got my prizes that I won from a previous lotto draw that I did my lotto for and then the situation got to a point that the other store assistant that served me spoke to the security guard who was on duty at the time I purchased my lottery tickets for the weekend and collecting my 2 free Daily millions Quick Picks by denying that I hadn't won anything on the 2 printed tickets that I handed to her to check for me and she kept on saying that I didn't win 2 free Daily millions Quick Picks and then the security guard asked me to leave the store when I demanded that I got my prizes that I won from the lottery and then eventually after waiting more than half an hour to be served I finally got served properly by a different store assistant who believed that I was telling the truth about me winning the 2 free Daily millions Quick Picks and she had to go back and forth to a checkout that I won the 2 free Daily millions Quick Picks on and she had to print out 2 of the tickets for me as the ones that had the prizes on said invalid ticket and throughout the half hour or so I was in the supermarket for I was very agitated and frustrated while I was waiting to be served properly by a store assistant as I wasn't too pleased with the store assistants and my customer service in the Santry Lidl except for the one who believed that I was telling the truth about winning the 2 free Daily millions Quick Picks and I would like for this store to get better staff who knows how to log into the lottery machines in Lidl in Santry and any other lidl stores around the country that sells the national lottery as the staff in Santry Lidl aren't great at serving the customers the lottery and they need to stop denying that the machines aren't working when they do be working and it's not fair that I had to wait half an hour or more to be served the lottery by a store assistant or anyone wishing to purchase the lottery as people should be served in a fair and polite manner rather than being sweared at over an issue which isn't their fault at all and having to wait half an hour or a long period of time to be served the lottery that want to purchase the lottery,Lidl
8,Great store with very helpful staff. Good discounts the hour before closing. Never too busy and quick to open a till if queue builds up. App is also great for more discounts. Customer service are quick to address and resolve any queries in a fair way.,Lidl
9,Typical Lidl place with lovely stuff. Good parking with wheelchair accessibility. Trolleys take 1/2e coins. Inside plenty of space and not too busy (except weekend I guess). Good choice of fruits/veggies/legumes/greens. Really recommend the place as the prices are decent and they have good discounts every now and then (check their website). Recommend.,Lidl
10,"Always good prices for general groceries and various types of alcoholic drinks, fresh fruit, meat, fish, vegetables and bread.",Lidl

13,"Very good supermarket. A lot of discount products and great deals. Just be careful with some deals, because they might be next to the expiration date. There's a large section of household items, some with nice prices. The cashier are very fast! Also, bring your own bag (you can buy here too, but what's the point of save money and then spend in bag?)",Lidl
14,"Very busy, few tills open as usual
Tesco has same prices now on loads of products but better quality I noticed recently.  Overall lidl goods store  but not for filling the trolley at the end of the week!!!",Lidl

16,"Good shopping experience. Produce fresh and tasty.  Quite a good variety of fruit & veg. Can sometimes seem a bit cluttered or 'busy', maybe due to narrow-ish aisles??

19,"Good variety, competitive prices and good service",Lidl
20,"This store has minimal staff. Two persons on the till with one person by the entrance playing on their mobile.
You're better off going next door to M&S to do your food shopping, as there is limited items on the shelves.",Lidl
21,"Cheap prices and decent selection of items. Won't have many things that aren't very mainstream in Ireland though... For example I couldn't get nutmeg or allspice powder, cornmeal, active dry yeast, or taco üåÆ shells. ‚Ä¶",Lidl
22,Restocking took up too much room. Eg boxes and trollys  Perhaps do it at night. I felt place was very impersonal.  Turnips were wrotten. Till guy just kept shoving my stuff. And i a pretty fast packing. Customers are humans.,Lidl
23,"Could improve with encouraging more adherence to social distancing and wearing of covid19 transmission preventing masks,  including the staff. Otherwise great value as usual.",Lidl
24,"Staff not very helpful, I asked a female member of staff where I would find a certain item and she just pointed and said "" down there "" and walked away. This was not the first time this has happened",Lidl
25,"Easy to find what ur looking for beautiful fresh flowers& plants that dosent break the bank the meat is very reasonable priced & it's irish meat you wouldn't put any other meat on ur plate at home,got a lovely chicken oh so juice y staff went out of the way at checkout helping me I,'ll be back to Aladdin cave for more bargains through the week",Lidl

43,"Not a pleasant experience, hard to get any attention form any staff member as they taking about private matters on the head sets all the time, great quality product as Lidl always have out sie from F&V that is rotten moste of the time due to lack of chill unit and very high temperature over the fresh stock.",Lidl

56,"I dont normally shop in Lidl but,as it was close by yesterday I dropped in. We only needed 1 or 2 items. There is something missing from this shop that I cant quite put my finger on. It lacks atmosphere, the shelves/baskets were very untidy. Also, I dont find the staff as friendly & as helpful as Aldi",Lidl

Do at your peril confuse this shops with poor quality this is far from the truth its value value value and great products. There is no excuse for not eating healthy anymore and these shops have saved many families from hardship. They are social miracles. We all have choices now in this country remarkable when you consider where we were in the 80s. I love these shops especially the tools and other man stuff they have or as my wife puts it ""Man creche"" My dog Teddy loves Lidl too.",Lidl

401,Approx,Lidl
1,The economical grocery store that offers weekly coupons. Super stores have huge collection.,Lidl
2,"One of the rudest staff they have compared to other Lidl
From manager to the staff on the floor this is my second time that's happened to me
I will never recommend this Lidl",Lidl
3,Vile horrible staff. From the manager all the way down to the security team. All horrible and rude.,Lidl
4,"Nice and pleasant staff. My daughter forgot her toy in store, in one day very polite men on the till give it back. Thank you for great service!",Lidl
5,"The automatic tills won't give you any time, they keep saying scan another item if you are more than 10 seconds between items. Products are good though.",Lidl
6,"Too expensive , meet has too many preservatives, I found only parma ham was with salt only and without any other preservatives. They should do the Pikok brand like no preservatives meet brand in Lidl in central Europe , see attached",Lidl
7,Extremely annoyed with the amount of tills in the self check outs that have been converted to card only . Cash is legal tender and I don't believe people should be pushed into only using their card . It also slows down the whole process as those customers like myself who only use cash are left waiting uncomfortable till as cash payment till becomes available.  I will be doing my shopping elsewhere in future,Lidl
8,"The Shop is a bit messy and the range is limited. Even though there is a long queue at the self checkout, they rarely open a proper till. It's alright if you just need a few things but not great to do the weekly shopping.",Lidl
9,"You have to know what to get in order to have a good experience. I would go here for most dry goods, the quality of the products tend to be as good if not better than other supermarkets and known brands, that's their niche. Would I go buy bread here? No, I wouldn't. But anything long life where they can negotiate good deals and volume means you get higher quality products for more affordable prices.",Lidl
10,"Hi, it's really nice that the place look great but gone off and rotten fruits are currently being sold. I bought a  net of oranges and strawberries recently and 80% of both fruits was spoiled and soggy. This is really worrying and has made me lose my confidence on how fresh the food is.",Lidl
11,"Better products, better price than other markets...but...
Do not try to find the products offered for free by the Lidl Plus app, you never find it and when you think you do, there is something different and you have to pay.",Lidl
12,"Good quality/price relation on vegs & fruits. As well as, with bread and pastry selection. However , there is a shortage of products while exhotic others are present. No great at stockage or basics. It feels like it lacks of variety and some quality on non eatable products",Lidl
13,"Vegetable is never restocked in the evening hours, during the whole week. Lots of empty shelves. I used to love lidl but I rather go to Aldi across since they always have the veggies restocked and everything else.",Lidl
14,"I like Lidl the most from all available supermarkets because they have better selection of the products and cheaper prices, then the others üôÇ Plus occasionally you can buy a really good stuff from the baskets for reasonable price and good qualityüëç Highly recommended üëå ‚Ä¶",Lidl
15,"It has all the necessary items, big enough, however I never find my oat milk in there could be due to the virus. Staff are very friendly, all of them are nice and helpful.",Lidl
16,"Stopped going in since the new tills. They make no sense at all. Queue is endless all the time, they should have made them self service .
pity because shop looks great and lovely bakery.",Lidl
17,"Fab selection of fresh fruit and vegetables. Very good meats too. Every time I buy fresh white fish fillets, there are always bones. So I don't buy their fish anymore. From time to time they have amazing cheese. Their wine selection is dreadful, some awful plonk, that Cimarosa is OK as vinegar on chips, nothing more. They have the same vintage Rose sitting on the shelf for 3 years now. Past it's best, and remains expensive. Good tea selection. Some good weekly offers too.üòÅ",Lidl
18,"I love this shop. This is shop for my regular shopping. I visit this shop atleast twice every week. Product quality is awesome and you can get products in very cheap rate. Aldi and this one, both are cheapest shops in Ireland with good quality products. Sometimes you can get clothes and other useful stuffs as well in special section.",Lidl
19,It used to be a good place for me to do my shopping as I live just around the corner.Now the check-out counters have changed.I don't wanna do my big shopping there anymore.I only go for few items as the checkout till is small and there is often a long queue there-a big put-off for me.,Lidl
20,"It's fine, they have a decent selection of stuff at a good price, but the service is always slow, the lines are always long and there's no buzz about the place. You'd be much better off going across the road to Aldi, where they open a new till the second the line gets too long and they have an amazing range of ""specially selected"" stuff.",Lidl
21,"The Lidl bakery is honestly the best deal for fresh bread, most items cost in or around a euro and the baskets are refilled constantly throughout the day. In other corners of Lidl: they have good Italian ham and, depending on the theme of the month, you could buy both a full motorcycle suit and a box of Krisped Rice (for example). The cheese section isn't great unfortunately. Very cheap, always a good time. Seriously the bakery is so good.",Lidl
22,"I have been to Lidl Rathmines today, it has been renovated recently and I must say it was better before. I had the worst experience ever at the check out - the tills are very small and not comfortables if you buy more than a couple of items. I was a loyal customer but I will never go there in the future to do my weelky / monthly shopping. Poor experience.",Lidl
23,"It was great, easy to found what I was looking for. Staff on the service scan was brilliant, and also so friendly. Not many customers in store, so social distance was great.",Lidl
24,Good space between the islands for accessing food all overall a good access bit of a letdown at the cash out only three people with long flowing no announcement that should rectify the fault but maybe they will take note of this,Lidl
25,"Plenty of options. Good price, offers. I even found panetone, which is Italian kinda of bread/cake. While most of Lidl have big queues, this one didn't have the 2 times I was there. But they should put self check out for sure.",Lidl
26,"Lidl in rathminds has a very poor check out system the que today was halfway back down the shop that is a regular occurrence on Saturday's and other busy days, lidl really has to go back to the drawing board with their check out system, and install fast lanes and automated check out systems avoid lidl on Saturday's and other busy days ,or maybe you like spending 30+ minutes in ques...
2 üåü",Lidl
27,There are always many things missing. It's smaller Lidl so it happens that you just find empty shelves because it's sold out. Especially afternoon when all people are buying groceries after work,Lidl
28,"Shopping at Lidl Rathmines is a wonderful, relaxing way to spend 3 hours on a sunny day. One meets the most interesting people and the staff are kind, knowledgeable and helpful. Food is sourced from all 5 corners of the globe and remains fresh and edible long after its sell by date. Thank you Aldi.",Lidl
29,Great prices ruined by the fact that some items appear on the shelves every couple of weeks so you gotta be extremely lucky to buy them again,Lidl
30,I find Lidl has a great range of food products and other houshold items (specials) at affordable prices. Staff are lovely and I get in and out quickly. Fab Shop. Mary Goggin üòÄ ‚Ä¶,Lidl
31,The cashier Emma with American accent was very rude to me when I asked about the price of the donuts. I was shocked ! Not even greeting to me and my wife . That‚Äôs not a service we expect in such a prestige neighbourhood!,Lidl
32,Well laid out. Good value. And sometimes  stuff you didn't know you needed,Lidl
33,Good location. Good selection of fruits and bakery corner. But not many choices of fresh salad leaves. Dairy products are ok.,Lidl
34,Lidl in the centre of Rathmines. Good COVID precautions and good offers. Lidl plus has definitely been a great addition in regards to offers. Just beware this Lidl wouldn't be as stocked in regards to the biweekly offers as others.,Lidl
35,"Good selection of produce and the bread is fine so ignore any comments saying not to buy it. The tills are ridiculous though, should be self-service.",Lidl
36,"Good prices , fresh products, mamy good oferts but always working just two checkout so you spend more time waithing to pay than selecting products.",Lidl
37,"It's a good a good lidl, has all the normal products you would expect. As its in the middle of rathmines village, it is limited in size and doesn't have as good a selection as the larger branches do. Beyond that, no complaints.",Lidl
38,"Loving the new layout, very stylish win the same good prices you'd expect from Lidl. Hopefully they'll sort the queuing system as they seem to have additional tills",Lidl
39,"Very good price for very good quality food I don't think any one would be able to tell the difference between a lidl steak or any meat compared with so called high end shopping centres like dunnes, tesco, m@s but yet these shops nearly double in price when compared with lidl the only small critic I would have with lidl is the veg an some of the other items is packaged for fambly value so shopping as a single person it's a minor inconvenience but wouldn't stop üõë me from shopping there I go to lidl a minimum 3 times a week an NEVER got bad or stale food. I'll continue to go to lidl food is cheaper, staff are great an I could eat a million of their triple choc cookie üç™ üòä",Lidl

41,Always my first choice for low price but high quality products.,Lidl
42,Tills are very very slow. New style tills are in use since reopened. The staff at the till asked me to lift the plastic wheelie basket up and place it on the basket holder so they can pick the items and scan. An elderly lady had trouble to lift the heavy basket and got a back pain because of trying to lift it.,Lidl
43,"Good LIDL store. Reasonable product range. The store is spacious, with enough aisle room. Good location in the middle of Rathmines. Right across the road from Aldi.
Checkouts as always are a pain in the ass at LIDL, feel under pressure to pack faster than the checkout person can scan (#firstworldproblem) !!!",Lidl
44,Would be nice if staff remembered social distancing rules at the till and reminded people to wait for their turn while the previous person is collecting their shopping :(,Lidl
45,"Good prices, good bakery items, but it always has queues to pay and during busy times there's never free baskets at the entrance.",Lidl

1,"Terrible Lidl. No baskets at its right place, we need to pick them up close to the cashier (if they have any!). Lights regularly turned off around the bakery area. Narrow alleys. Very long queues (2 or 3 cashiers working at most). Inefficient security people. Plastic recycling machines very often out of service. dirty floor. Constant lack of supply in the food area. Often out of plastic at the veg area, and the list goes on...

Taking for example Lidl Smithfield, it's day and night with Lidl on Thomas St.",Lidl

So no 1 star should be giving. Almost everything in Lidl PRICE is STATED WRONG. This in on loads of the products.  This should not be allowed. And the bread/ cakes  is not covered from flies and dust.
I do not even find staff helpful.
Nothing I like about this shop.
And never enough tills open.",Lidl
10,"One star because there is no option to give no stars. The green haired woman who works as sales person was as impolite as one could be. Then we wanted to pay and she asked if I was 25 because its legally not possible to sell alcohol to a under 25 year old, which is nonsense. And even if it was like this, she was just too rude, to everyone. Not going there ever again.",Lidl

Good lighting, higher standard refrigeration equipment, improved client orientation. Clean! Even the tills are 2020. I saw the first Lidl in the 90s on the Italian Riviera. To Thomas street it was like a market stand to Brown Thomas! And the bus stop is right in front of the door. You can leave your Bentley home and Lidl shop by bus! 13, 40, 123.
Only disappointment: no baskets on wheels anymore. The handheld ones are too small, the caddies too big...",Lidl
15,"Refurbished store is easy to navigate, wide aisles and can reach all shelves as a short person.

There can be some great finds in the orange sticker discount range.

Great value for money, especially for bags of dried fruit and nuts. I'm always amazed at how little I spend here for the amount of groceries that I bring home!

Always plenty of fresh food in stock!

Staff are efficient and friendly, extra tills open if queues are building.

Thanks Lidl, keep up the stellar work.",Lidl

Have returned goods before without any complication.",Lidl

21,Really good quality spotless clean love the bread when entering store always pick up a loaf or 2 great that the machine is there to slice my loaf of bread to the thickness I prefer also using a lot of store brands are much cheaper and not much of a difference could be more staff at hand on tills as cues get really long at times but other wise I shop here on a daily basis and will keep on doing so keep up the good work Lidl üåû,Lidl
22,I was at this supermarket to work. Withdraw all the food from the shelves as they would pack the shelves. The way they do that is awful. They want speed and less care. The treatment sucks. I do not buy any more in this place. They should hire people who are careful about what others are going to buy to eat. We are not pigs.,Lidl
23,"Good shop generally as Lidl usual with good bakery. Nice and tidy except the non-food section is messy. Also not much non food items for sale, only 2 small isles..small but good Lidl.",Lidl
24,"I do my weekly shopping from this branch. Very friendly staff, quick service even in long queues. My favourite place for vegetables and fruits. Not only reasonably priced but very fresh too. Organic milk and eggs are must try items. I think the best free range eggs you can get I am not too sure about milk and its local.",Lidl
25,"a very strong point of this place is the availability of schedules. is always open in long periods of time. always with good products and a very tasty confectionery with fresh products. the service is always very good and surely this place is suitable for anyone who is looking for products for home, cleaning, cooking, items for the home.",Lidl
26,Crowded. No self-checkout tills. The flor is dirty. The baskets have fruit and vegetables left inside. So definitely not sanitized and or looked after. No social distancing observed what so ever. The only bright side are the people working there who are giving it all they have to work in these conditions. Avoid if possible.,Lidl
27,It's been good since they have redone the store. Everything is always well stocked up. The specials section is still not like the bigger stores. That's probably the only negative point.,Lidl
28,This store is the worst lidl I have ever been in. It is totally disorganized. The staff are friendly  but overworked. The produce is substandard I am using it because Cork St is closed  just now. Cork St was a joy to shop in it was very well managed and the staff were brilliant.  I can't wait for it to reopen.,Lidl
29,Great shop! But please... Please.. fix those baskets with squeaky wheels !! Its like a torture to shop in there with all that loud squeaky noise.,Lidl
30,Good product selection and the best Lidl staff in all of Ireland :) No self checkout :(,Lidl
31,"It's a Lidl, what else do you need to know?
This Lidl is a smaller one than other stores so it doesn't have the same selection of goods. It has most of what you'll need though for a quick stop on the way home from work.
Their alcohol section is quite reduced though, and they have a lot less of the ""random""/seasonal items that the bigger Lidl stores have. Still, for what it is, it is fine and is handy to have in the area.",Lidl
32,"The store manager Akil was shockingly rude on the till. He kept his headset on and was talking to staff somewhere else in the store. The lady ahead of me asked three times for a bag and he eventually threw one at her. No please, no thank you.
He didn't even make eye contact with anyone. Then he yawned as wide as the liffey and proceeded to serve me. Again no acknowledgement at all. He was so rude that I made sure to say ""Thank you Akil"" to his face nicely and clearly...he just ignored me.
If he is managing then the staff have no hope.",Lidl
33,"Great place not too many queues. Self service tills, in my opinion are great, its less of a rush. Love Lidl in Moore street has lots of them. Thanks",Lidl
34,Terrible store to shop in....I like lidl  as a whole regarding larger stores but Thomas Street branch is just not for the customer especially family's as you have to pass through the array of drunks sitting at the front door which can be very intimidating. ... products are constantly placed under the wrong price point ...the Isles are very narrow & constantly full of pallet trucks packing out stock which I understand that is necessary but not prime time when the store is so busy also not a great selection of stock regarding what would be advertised in the weekly flyer...,Lidl
35,Clean well stocked good specials ..a god send if I'm honest. Fresh food from around the world...its a far cry from the bananas and oranges which sat atop prams when I was a kid. So many healthy options for people without having to travel far or pay exotic prices. Lidle is amazing for Ireland in general I also found almost tevery diy tool I need here as well. At bargain prices. Drill bits and corner clamps and stain for the shed and Protecting gel.. Can get my whole shed fixed now! Love it!,Lidl
36,"Lidl is currently operating in what I assume is a temporary capacity in Thomas St, as the original shop undergoes a revamp.
So the situation is far from pleasing to the Lidl customer. Today the shop was like a fridge , and not just around the expected cold areas.
Also the smell of burning rubber from the adjacent new premises was nauseating.
Add the amount of dust built up from the work and you get the picture.
I can't blame the staff, as they have an impossible job and they have my sympathy.
But Lidl should have thought of these problems before they undertook their reconstructions
Since the renovations have been completed,  Lidl has become a good and organised supermarket.
The staff are friendly and helpful and the products on sale are good and reasonably priced. Lately, like a lot of supermarkets,  they have suffered from lack of supplies but thar is entirely understandable.",Lidl
37,I like this place. It's my favourite place to making shopping. Cheap products and great quality. Is only one problem. Car park. No one in front of the shop and in the back very early closing,Lidl
38,"Good store, very handy as it's right on the bus stop (Bridgefoot Street) on Thomas Street. A bit smaller than the one on Moore Street but well stocked and also less busy. Has fresh bread! üôÇ ‚Ä¶",Lidl
39,"It is a cheaper grocery store that has good products and a reasonably wide range of products.
It's open 7 days a week and has good promotions from time to time.
Opening hours are 8-22 each day apart from Sunday when the shop closes at 18.
It's similar to Aldi but with a little wider range of products that Aldi in Parnell Street.",Lidl
40,"As all Lidl, great shop with a large selection of great products with cheap prices but good quality. Always found a good deal. A lot of bakery products fresh and still warm with so nice smell of bread when you go in :)",Lidl
41,"Unbeatable prices.
Well stocked outlet.
Perfectly satisfactory shop every time, never disappoints.
Excellent staff.
Brilliant customer service.
Dazzling, clean store.",Lidl
42,"If you want to wait very long between drunken people, one of the worst....very sad!",Lidl
43,"Great for the essentials not so much if you're looking for the specials.
Bright.  Clean and friendly as you'd expect.",Lidl
44,It's a fine convenience grocery with a nice baked goods area just inside the front entryway.,Lidl
45,"What can I say! Sliced pan and 16 jumbo sausages ‚Ç¨3.73. Try beat that, absolutely great value for money.",Lidl
46,"Good selection of groceries, probably the best supermarket in the area. It does however suffer from a lack of space and therefore the three checkout lines usually have huge queue which in turns makes it difficult to browse some of the aisles.",Lidl
47,Good shop but I shop late and I find shelves getting empty and no one replace stock,Lidl
48,I always able to find some veggies and fruits package free. It would be great to see bigger variaty of loose products. Also a good place to buy bread withou additional unnecessary plastic!,Lidl
49,Good quality food at low prices however the new layout is awkward and at bust times it can be quite hard to navigate the Isles while I love lidl in general the Thomas Street is badly layed out and planned even after the renovations were carried out and there's still no access to the car park via the shop itself that said the staff are very helpful and friendly and the manager knows the layout and lack of access is an issue,Lidl
50,"One of the biggest lidil in Dublin city. The stock is really good and there is dedicated sections for most of the things. Also they have cheap coffee machine in the entrance. The bakery section is also pretty huge and they have a lot of different items there.

More tills makes less queues and thats the thing here.",Lidl
51,CONGRATS TO ALL THE MANAGERMENT AND TEAM ON A WONDERFUL JOB. HIGH FIVE AND FIVE GOLDEN STARS TO ALL THE MANAGERMENT AND TEAM FOR KEEPING THE SHOPPING COST DOWN FOR ALL YOU'RE CUSTOMERS. I LOVE THAT. 100% WONDERFUL JOB. YE THINKING OF ALL YOU'RE CUSTOMERS 1ST THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SHOP IS TOP OF THE CLASS. CONGRATS AGAIN.,Lidl
52,"Always a pleasure :* Love smashing that green happy face on the way out. The staff are like family... who i dont speak to and whose names i don't know. XXL is the specialty range on at the moment. Not my favourite by a stretch but just dont have the heart to drop a star from the rating. Got the brazilian lad on the checkout today. Pretty sure my gf fancies him. But anyway, Well deserved lads. Keep on serving the community",Lidl
53,"Even thought not a big shop, they still have almost every item that they sell at the Lidl shop at Moore Street. The main advantage is that this shop is not so crowded and hence you still get all the fruits and vegetables even if you are a little late to go to shop in the weekends.",Lidl
54,In general i like lidls brand alot. But this one needs some renovations to be done. I understand that this one is in one most expensive citys centre of the all world and that particular store is in old building so is very squeezed. Is not alot of space inside is quite busy and staff is professional nice for the customers but usually is just not enough of them. More just sometimes fresh bakery is just not there or long queues at the till. While two people at the tills working hard there is nobody there to help them.,Lidl
55,"The redhair woman cashier was very  unprofessional and inopportune i don't know how some people can work.
She mocked my cousin with down syndrome with her colleague. Unacceptable.",Lidl
56,"The queueing time in this branch is almost always horribly long but staff members are very kind and helpful! Also, due to the size of this store, neither the selection is as huge as that in most of other Lidl stores in Dublin available. For example in their Cork Street branch which is about 700m away.",Lidl
57,"Head here some lunch times, queue's are ridiculous most days. Aisles are small so it can get cramped around the tills. Smaller than a lot of Lidl's but has a decent enough selection of goods.",Lidl
58,Good local store to do your shopping but unfortunately recently I've noticed a lot of products in the magazine are not available which can be disappointing,Lidl
59,"As with all Lidl stores there is a good selection of products which are well-priced with each area clearly marked. Staff are well-trained, pleasant and helpful so even when the store is busy there is usually not much delay in being served",Lidl
60,19 people waiting in the line for one open cashier. This I call a weird way of serving. Never ever aigain I will visit this place.,Lidl
61,"Always affordable prices, quick staff even in busy times. Buying there for 8 years now. The deals of the day are fantastic.",Lidl
62,"Some product where just in the open with no rules of hygienic, people got no mental value of stuff, some workers where rude. I even got sick from eating once from there bakery choices. Lidl in Belgium are alot better then here.",Lidl
63,"Early in the morning best timing for the shop,  after it is a bit messy. Staff always cordial and ready to help.  Queue at the till generally fast.",Lidl
64,I went earlier and I disabled so I got everything I needed and a good price some pricing hard to follow if bub,Lidl
65,"Worst supermarket you can experience. Rough staff. Dirty, unorganised... Back to the roots. Still being an incredible dirty place! I only can think that management here is not doing the job.",Lidl
66,"Lidl Thomas Street is great since the big refurb - clean and well lit, nice bread and good stocks of everything else you'd expect - and the staff are friendly! Highly recommended.",Lidl
67,"Nice shop close to the city center. Discount prices, limit selection (though it has all the basics) and good quality. Fast checkout.",Lidl
68,"It's newly refurbished, more space, great bakery. I would go there anyway for the prices. It's certainly a bit busier after the builders left.",Lidl
69,Had some empty shelves but I was able to buy everything I needed. Also it wasn't too busy which is great!,Lidl
70,"Unprepared,and rude staff.
They don't follow their own rules and are not prepare to explain them to customers either.",Lidl
71,First time here since the refurbishment - nice to see it but noticed there are no self service checkouts.,Lidl
72,"This particular Lidl on Thomas street Dublin is a joke. Very badly stocked, pallets of unpacked goods and empty boxed strewn all over the floor. And the worst is that there was one till open with a queue of over 10 people and a cashier that scanned the shopping so slowly and then can't make eye contact with you when you speak
Very poor. Worst Lidl ever",Lidl
73,"Visited 27th December early around 9:15am, it was lovely and quiet with good amount of stock and fresh fruit and vegetables",Lidl
74,Good place to shop but only on your own. It is a very small branch and most of the time busy with a long queue at the cashier,Lidl
75,"Very helpful workers, I wish I could buy Goody Cao here, just like in the Lidl from Poland and Italy.",Lidl
76,Don't expect great service but it has a good stock of good at competitive prices.. good for bulk purchases for monthly groceries,Lidl
77,Nice. Staff is nice and apart from usual cheap corner  cutting things it has a lot of good stuff too,Lidl
78,"Love going here, lots of choice great value for money and very nice staff always smiling üëåüëåüëå ‚Ä¶",Lidl
79,Decent selection of foods on sale here. Can get busy. Sorry.,Lidl
80,"It's a small lidl, doesn't have everything you normally find in LIDL like electronics or clothes. Mostly food. Queues for checkouts are usually packed and wait is long any time of day.",Lidl
81,It's still a great Lidl but it's shocking how the veg is understocked compared to other Lidls in Dublin.,Lidl
82,A little on the cramped side if I'm honest. Often times there is a conciderable wait for a casheer. That said I like LIDL's food so go there regularly.,Lidl
83,The only reason why I am not giving it a 5 star is because it does not have chilled drinks. You need to buy then in advance and chill them at home.,Lidl
84,"Good layout,well stocked and friendly. Ideal city centre supermarket. The sort of place you can get around quickly.",Lidl
85,Always friendly staff and very clean.... Bakery food 90% of time straight out of oven yum yum love this place,Lidl
86,"One the best Lidl , well managed but i miss the self checkout tills here
Other then that its a good store to buy groceries and stuff",Lidl
87,Service is terrible long queues and 8 tills closed same every day,Lidl
88,It can be messy and they don't replace anything until the next day. Amazing prizes and interesting items :),Lidl
89,"Messy, quite dirty, repetitive food selection.",Lidl
90,All ok till got to the till the cashier must have been I a rush home telling me the shop was closed yet it was only 2 minutes to 10 but all's well that' ends well cheers,Lidl
91,Products are solid and inexpensive but the shopping experience is not the same. Guess you get what you pay for.,Lidl
92,"A rather basic but good shop in the middle of the historic district of Dublin: The Liberties.  Lidl has all range of fruit, vegetables, food and fish/meat plus toiletries.",Lidl
93,Could have more variety on the items offered. In the last hours many products don't get replaced on shelves.,Lidl
94,"Long queue, but moved quickly. I shop during the day so they have all of the vegetables I'm looking for.",Lidl
95,"As you know Lidl is cheap :) good choice of food and always some special offers, every week different food from different countries as offer. Well done.",Lidl
96,Always busy but has pretty much everything you'd want at an affordable price.,Lidl
97,"Great to shop there, very cheap and staff are always happy to help, and friendly, best quality and service",Lidl
98,Not very good selection of basic food stuffs like condiments and canned foods.  Decent meat and dairy section and fresh pastries.,Lidl
99,Very convenient as its beside me always like checking out the specials,Lidl
100,"Handles bags - it's incredible!
Thanks üëç
You are the best!!! ‚Ä¶",Lidl

103,Can't wait till it opens back up next week always get good deals  üòÑ ‚Ä¶,Lidl
104,Busy half the time. A lot of food choices. Big lines at he till. One of best prises in food.,Lidl
105,"the Qs in this shop are a joke there is simply not enough staff working in this Lidl unit, most of the staff look like they could use a holiday, they look like over worked and very tired worn out horses, there is always a Q, they seem to be missing some products other lidl units would have, I use it as the bread corner it has is great but that's it, the rest is a joke.
I know the area well, all of my 43 years alive, I have never come across one local working in the store?

Get your act together LIDL.",Lidl
106,Closest to me. City prices seem higher.. But staff were good and shop tidy,Lidl
107,A great improvement since their renovations and staff have been excellent.,Lidl
108,Good variety things and really good prices. I think is better than the others like tesco or spar.,Lidl

480,"I think it's a large supermarket that many locals go to. Tesco in downtown Dublin is small, but this one slightly outside is larger and has a lot of variety. The difference is especially big with beer! It's worth going shopping",Lidl
481,Very well stocked supermarket. The best in this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDublin. The oven department has an excellent quality/price ratio. And as an Italian I have to say that Lidl's bronze-drawn pasta isn't bad either. 5 stars.,Lidl
482,"Well maintained store. Wide range available. Staff was very helpful and friendly. No gluten-free or lactose-free products available.
Vegetables and fruits are very fresh.",Lidl

487,"What is most impressive is the pace of renovation work. I sincerely admire all this coordination with rearranging products, etc. The management staff and ""rank and file"" employees are at the highest level. Congratulations! :-)",Lidl
488,"The usual business where you are happy to enter also because it has the same items as in Italy. Good assortment and good value for money, always worth taking a look as I do in Italy at the no food section where you can often find things at excellent prices.",Lidl
489,10/10 best offers lan - 4ct discount simply thick - abda!,Lidl
490,The price is not indicated on all products. It is very uncomfortable for a new buyer. The price policy is somewhat overstated.,Lidl
491,"Decent bakery area for breakfast.
However, a terrible checkout hostess and staff passing in front of us at the checkout without apologizing or without a word to anyone.
Staff should learn the basics of business.",Lidl
492,"Good, pretty and, if you're lucky, with 30% discount items such as beef, salads or hake fillets. Much cheaper than Tesco and with some products even more than at Dealz. Personal recommendation: the 1 kilogram lasagna for 3 euros, quite filling and takes away your hunger. Excelsior beer for 75 cents is the cheapest you can find in Ireland and is drinkable.",Lidl
493,"Prices are up, but inside it looks like they're broke and about to move out. The staff is very friendly and drinks are significantly cheaper than in a normal supermarket",Lidl
494,"The store is quite small, so it's pretty tight when there are a lot of people shopping. The selection of items also leaves a lot to be desired.",Lidl

1,I recommend Lidl Tyrrelstown.  This is the local shop in Tyrrelstown community.  Very clean shop and a lot of variety for your daily shopping. Friendly and useful staff as well. Recommend it üôåüçÜüôå ‚Ä¶,Lidl
2,"Have always come here for shopping and staff are lovely but since the refurbishment, the cleanliness level doesn‚Äôt seem the same. There is also a foul smell in the middle of the store of sewage which really puts me off walking down an entire 2 rows as it is disgusting. Not sure why something hasn‚Äôt been done about this as I‚Äôve noticed it now for months. The security also seem very intimidating right off the bat. From the moment you walk in the front door you feel as thought you are being watched. They should have a post with cameras where they sit as does the SuperValu security",Lidl
3,Its my local market nd i m happy with quality of products but some new faces in the till are very rude. Regular staff is very nice nd helpful.,Lidl
4,"A good shop not as cheap as it started of with ,you really need to know your prices while shopping as other supermarkets may be cheaper for some items,of course the middle isles are as alway full of bargains.The staff are very polite and helpful,makes for a good atmosphere.",Lidl
5,"Good, easy to get location with very big parking area.
It is always good for quick buy or for bigger weekly shopping.
Nice range of products, not as big as in Tesco or Dunnes, but it is even better for me.",Lidl
6,Recently a lot of daily food hasn't been in stock. Last time cottage cheese was sold here was a good 2 weeks ago and it doesn't look like they're gonna bring it back,Lidl
7,The bakery here is amazing and the staff have always been very helpful and friendly. There's a lot more parking since the renovation in 2022 and the store is also bigger and more modern.,Lidl
8,Easy to shop friendly staff good parking.,Lidl
9,Great Shop Loads of Parking Too!!!,Lidl
10,I have read reviews but when I went I couldn't see much difference in the price but yes it's a good place to buy everything at one place and sometimes it's worth the price....,Lidl
11,"I went to Lidl to buy tiramisu and they said it‚Äôs not permitted for under 18s, tiramisu was permitted to be bought for people at any age",Lidl
12,Great look to the new store. Nice and spacious. Plenty of parking with EV chargers and the inclusion of washers and dryers. Highly recommended.,Lidl
13,"I never usually write reviews but I felt like I needed to address this situation. I often shop here as it is my local super market. It is handy for many items. The staff are always kind and helpful. I never usually have any issues‚Ä¶ I was doing some shopping with my partner today at approx 4:30pm. As soon as I walked into the store, I felt the security guard‚Äôs eyes on me. He acted as if I was guilty from the moment I walked into the store. As I walked through the aisles, he followed me with his eyes and when I walked further, he followed my direction. He made me feel uncomfortable and his behaviour was unacceptable. I am sure I am not the only person who felt this judgement from him. Following people around the store, blankly staring at me while I‚Äôm shopping for groceries and even coming so close to my partner that he nearly knocked his shopping out of his hand (no apology). I have never felt this type of hatred from someone in a store. I know that the area isn‚Äôt completely safe, but to stare at people and follow them around is completely ridiculous and useless. There was absolutely no need for this. I did not feel safe in the store and I will also reconsider shopping here in the future; especially when Supervalu is just across the road and the security guard there does his job in a way which does not interfere with innocent customers. I suggest the store invests in some cameras and an alarm system rather than having one awful security guard, standing in on side of the store, staring at only one person at a time.",Lidl
14,There's always cues there sure be more tills opens,Lidl
15,"Go here every day to pick of pretty much anything from their bakery which is delicious, personal favourites are these apple turnovers.",Lidl
16,Large variety of products and good prices stays :),Lidl
17,"Always clean, staff always nice and always fully stocked",Lidl
18,The lady in till 2 with spectacles was so rush in counter even there is only 1 person behind me..just throwing of the items after scanning..didn‚Äôt expect this kind of attitude so rude‚Ä¶,Lidl
19,It is good place for shopping,Lidl
20,They put a product on the app and say it's free when they never even had the product in store in the first place. Cashier treated the customer with very poor manners and called for the manager to the till to deal with a 'rude customer' when they were only trying to scan the lidl plus app.,Lidl
21,Big place. Business shop food. Good price. Good service,Lidl
22,"Nice spacious store. Plenty of products. Very busy, spacious car park, staff very helpful and friendly.
Worth a visit.",Lidl
23,Terrible for fruit. 95 per cent unripe or else over ripe. Even found mould growing. I complained twice. Zero done but i expected that. Cant get full fat live yogurt. Tired of their inconsistency with supplies. Glad i dont eat cake or ice cream.  Poor quality.  All their Norwegian fish id be afraid to eat. Disgusting smoked salmon and the pates are as bad as Iceland types..,Lidl
24,Love Lidl shops for all the special buys. I just wish they would get more stock of them in. Or do an order system for them. That way they wouldn't be left with loads of stock. This store is quite a large one. They have a huge range of things even without all the special buys. They've really helped to drive down the prices for all their competitors. Staff are friendly and helpful. I'd also love if they had self service check outs as sometimes I go in and only buy a small amount and have to queue behind people with trolley loads. This would make the shopping experience so much better.,Lidl
25,"Many things out of stock, unhelpful and very rude staff members. Irish staff are polite and willing to help, but when it comes to polish, latvian, russian whatever speaking staff, they are mostly rude, ignorant and unhelpful. Should hire better employees for the job.",Lidl
26,"The only reason I give it a 2 star is for the lovely staff,
The biggest issue is the long ques,people are half way up the aisle with only 1 or 2 tills open,I've walked out a few times over waiting to long,there should be an express till for 10 items or less an on busy times open extra tills.",Lidl
27,"I am absolutely disgusted at this shop.
Four times in a row we've noticed the Pip and Pair babyfood has been OUT OF DATE, FOUR TIMES!!!
After the first time we have mentioned it to them we'd expect the problem to be fixed but 3 more times after that it's happened! Very dangerous for babyfood.",Lidl
28,Its Lidl products and prices as usual. Well sticked but thrle high traffic of customers means it can be a little bit grubby.,Lidl
29,"Good selection of products, but the environment is off putting for some people, due to this store employing security guards who are much too in your face when you are just trying to do your shopping peacefully.",Lidl
30,"Watch out if you shop here. Today i saw one of the workers taking inventory take mask off and have a nice misty sneeze all over vegetable and fruit boxes. He said sorry, put his mask back on and continue to take inventory. Wash your fruit and veggies, its middle of pandemic and lockdown!!!",Lidl
31,Staff are nice. But have found when you buy fruit its gone off two days later. Also electrical items are a no go. Everything g breaks.,Lidl
32,"I often use this local Lidl but been going to it less and less over the years. I've seen a dew things happen inside that were not pretty. Seen a white man being racist towards a black man and also seen kids stealing chocolates from the store. Staff is good, always polite and willing to help.",Lidl
33,Spacious...lots of parking ..quite Tyrellstown location,Lidl
34,"I love this store, the staff are very pleasant and friendly including the security guard John. Fresh meat is very tasty and always has plenty on display. So much better and friendlier than the Tyrrelstown store üëç ‚Ä¶",Lidl
35,"Really good selection of food in here and nice enough staff.

Only complaint is at certain times especially in the summer feels the way they store their fruit and veg could be better as it's packages are full of moisture and they go off faster than usual which is rather disapointing :(",Lidl
36,"Always good value for top class veggies,  fruit,  fish and meats.  Wine list gets better and better. Madagascar Vanilla ice cream top marks.",Lidl
37,Very good as always.  This branch in no different to the branch on which I previously commented.  I possibly might mention for any one not familiar with Lidl that checkouts are much faster than most supermarkets. You get through quicker and you pay less.,Lidl
38,Tried to exchange a bottle of wine 20 minutes after purchase and was totally dismissed as it is not their policy. Will never set foot in there again.,Lidl
39,Quality everyday items can be bought here. The company should really look in to their staff. Specially the one that sits on the tills. As of today I was at the till getting my stuff and the girls on the tills kept talking to each other in their native tongue. witch I find very rude as there was customers around and they could be talking and making jokes of us. Sadly this is not the first time.,Lidl
40,Great experience ever time but you need more floor staff for customers to ask questions.Ive offer left without something I want because of lack of staff,Lidl
41,"My favourite supermarket by far. There's an amazing variety of fruit and veg and pretty much everything in the shop. The bakery is always well stocked and you can be assured that everything is fresh and tasty.

Lidl really is the one stop shop for everything you need at home and even things you don't need and didn't know you wanted before :) Their tools are above average quality and are very handy for diy jobs at home. The price of some of the tools could be a bit cheaper as a higher quality brand is in the same price bracket as a few of their tools.

Overall a great experience at Lidl.",Lidl
42,"Now and again I like a bottle of wine.  I usually look out for the 3 for ‚Ç¨25 special.  On one particular visit to my local lidl store, I had seen the 3 for ‚Ç¨25 sign so I made my way towards the wine section and began to pick my 3 bottles of wine.  The sign was actually very confusing because while at the checkout I Was told my choice of wine came to over  ‚Ç¨35. I had told the man at the checkout that I picked from the  3 for  ‚Ç¨25 section.  He went over had a look and came back.  He then put my 3 chosen bottles of wine to the side and completely  ignored my pleas for him to check again. I had also told him the signs were very misleading and incorrect but  I was just ignored again.  I left the shop extremely angry!  In my opinion this was deliberate! The signs are there to confuse people into thinking they are getting a good deal.  So when at the checkout instead of kicking up a fuss they end up paying over  ‚Ç¨35 instead of the ‚Ç¨25 they had originally  planned to spend!  This was not the first time I had experienced this! The signs are clearly misleading and need to be changed sooner rather than later!",Lidl
43,Good range of products - reasonably priced-friendly and helpful staff.,Lidl
44,Is close before time,Lidl
45,"Great to have this store back and its better, bigger and brighter. Fantastic!!",Lidl
46,"Okay....
Que can be quite long at times.
Quality of fruit and veg is good.
Middle aisle has gotten more expensive recent weeks.",Lidl
47,"Best fruits&veggies comparing to other supermarkets. Bakery is super nice, especially the new donuts range. Kids biscuits/juice/crisps multi packs are soo good! Highly recommend!",Lidl
48,"Came today to buy some groceries, hoping everything would go smoothly as most of the times but once I reached the till, finished purchasing, the woman staff asked me do you want receipt and I said yes but then was left standing there waiting for that bloody receipt for bleedin 10 mins, while she served other customer. Soon after she finished serving the other customer I told her in a frustrated way where is my receipt? She replied did you buy something, I said yes and you told me you'll give me the receipt but she said no I didn't. We kept on arguing and eventually just left the shop very unhappy with the shopping experience. The staff member was either Latvian, polish or moldovian. Very rude, ignorant and unprofessional. Lastly I advice anyone reading this to visit blanchardstown Lidl instead of Tyrrellstown
one, they're better staff working there and more stock.",Lidl
49,"You can almost get everything you would normally buy in your local shops.items on special offers, sell out very fast.Lidl supply a picture magazine for items on offer in the next two weeks.Staff are extra helpful and polite.Huge amount of foodstuffs very cheap.  Very popular with buying public.they are also online.",Lidl
50,"With Regret I had no option other than put down my intended shopping on a empty checkout and leave the shop Haveing completed my shop of aprox 10 items I approached checkout still serving a customer, to be barked at by operator closed.... Other two checkouts had aprox 10/12 people queuing berween them with large amounts of shopping meening a long wait.... I won't be back.",Lidl
51,"you will always wait a long time to pay, never it is full, always empty and has no bread, it is very messy and a 1 star is too much.  Close these shopp nothing good there",Lidl
52,"Live this store in blakestown. It's huge,  the same design as the one in Newry.  Lots of space, isles are nice and wide.  Just love the layout.",Lidl
53,There were very limited stock in the freezer chest and shelves today. I was not able to buy all I wanted and i have only limited days doing my grocery. I'm disappointed,Lidl
54,"Very good as always.
Great choice and value.
Quick and efficient.
AND the best real gluten free options when compared to super valu etc.",Lidl
55,"Great store, always parking available, decent location and quality food products. Staff rotate a lot but key people up there are always very friendly and helpful",Lidl
56,Staff ok could employ more Irish people need more assistants for the public on shop floor but saying that gorgeous bread fruit and veg very fresh nearly everything you need on your doorstep. üòãüòã ‚Ä¶,Lidl
57,"Lidl in Tyrrelstown is indeed sticking out in allowing a full shop where 2/3 of the customers wear either no mask or just have it hanging under their chin. Given the high increase in numbers and we are facing unknown variants, I have not seen another store allowing this behaviour to this extend. It is shameful. No wonder we are incapable getting this plague under control with store management not taking responsibility and ownership of their facilities. The hand sanitisers were also empty. This is not safe to shop there. I recommend to stay away.",Lidl
58,"Great  experience always,great availability and clean shop Staff always going the extra mile ,and friendly.Great parking availability also.",Lidl
59,"Good prices, could increase their quality,
Sometimes are short of stock, and for long periods of time you can find certain items, but is like that on every Lidl in Ireland.",Lidl

65,"Big shop, staff cannot keep up to restock items most of the time. So you walking empty shelfs",Lidl
66,"Plenty of parking, well stocked, Staff mannerly, some shopper's still not wearing Masks",Lidl
67,"It is a one stop shop,I got everything I wanted for groceries",Lidl
68,This store in particular always out of some products no matter when i go say i have 10 items to purchase it guaranteed 3 out of 10 will be unavailable. Maybe this is just unlucky all the time,Lidl

70,"Amazing new Lidl shop, spacious, environment friendly, looks fantastic, electric car charger in the car park.",Lidl
71,"Recently renovated, good parking space and wide variety of products and good service",Lidl
72,"Love that they bake fresh bread in the store. Vegs and fruits are good but sometimes they don't last long at home (a general problem in Ireland though). Lidl has good quality products and good offers. Cashier corridor is very narrow for the twins pushchair, you need to go out by the entrance and go inside by the exit so you can collect your products and pay, staff is very helpful though. Also, they will open for you the door to the toilets if you see yourself in that kind of circumstance.",Lidl

95,"Massive ques and I have never seen more then two people serving. This lidl has actually made me dread going shopping. When I was pregnant and needed the bathroom it took me around 15 mins after getting passed to different employees to finally be told to ask the girl serving, bare in mind there was a massive que and again she was the only one serving so had to leave her till to bring me.

1,"The all new Lidl at Baldoyle is so well. It also has fresh bakery now making it one stop shop for all grocery needs. Only one concern, there seems to be no restocking schedule in the afternoon, so if you visit in the evening some of the things you will find out of shelves. Try to visit in the morning hours, it will be less crowded and you will have most of the items freshly stocked.",Lidl
2,I love the fresh bread selection here the sourdough my favourite and cheaper than other supermarkets!,Lidl
3,A shop with all the essential household items at reasonable prices. The arrangement is similar to other LiDL shops. A 20 min walk from Clongriffin station.,Lidl
4,Came to return things I bought in this lidl and in other lidl. They said that from other shop they can accept return only below 40e? What? Are they making up new rules specifically at this branch? I did not argue as I was with my kid. I am not coming back to this Lidl.,Lidl
5,Great range of products at a good price,Lidl
6,"I love this  Liddle, but why all the time there are so big queues? need self service check out.",Lidl
7,"Generally Lidl has what we need for our shopping. A good range of food. Better priced than some other shops in the locality.

Watch out for mould growing on the fresh food, I have seen it several times and point it out. Cashiers are friendly but some have a tendency to launch the products down the belt while you are packing. This is not exclusive to this store, it is a Lidl issue.

Plenty of wide parking spaces outside.",Lidl
8,"Staff so helpful. In Lidl Baldoyle!
Love shopping in this store!",Lidl
9,The worst Lidl in Town. Arrogant staff. I went there to swap a jacket and they said I cant because it was bought in Coolock. I did it million times in another Lidl. They need training how to work. I had the receipt and there were still selling the same piece.,Lidl
10,"Not crowded, nice selection of products",Lidl
11,"Although it's size means that occasionally things can run out quickly the staff are always prompt about restocking if available produce is best. The staff are courteous, helpful and have done an absolutely amazing job throughout the entire pandemic and beforehand. The store is also clean and fairly well maintained too.",Lidl
12,"Prices are good. Quality is mostly excellent, especially cleaning products. Checkout is quick but you have to be quick to pack (maybe a negative !) I love their cheese. Not so good on wholemeal and wholegrain products (e.g. wholemeal pasta and rice) I don't eat meat so cant comment. Always gets good reviews from fellow shoppers.",Lidl
13,"Absolutely discrace! Management should run customer service skills before they hire staff. Today I was with my child  buying few things, products were on display without prices which is serious breach . On the till black man sales staff"" start shouting and arguing then security came and start giving out front of all people because we mention the price on bill and price on display did not match. My child got really frightened so I have to agree with them that is my fault not theirs and leave. Really discrafeful staff will not recommend to any one",Lidl
14,"Quite well presented shop with a big parking in front.
The trolleys are right in front of the main entrance so they can't be missed.
The area inside of store is well organized and spacious, so even during pandemic shopping everyone has enough space to push the trolley around.
Variety of widespread bakery products is good same as fruits and vegetables.
Quite good example of how every Lidl should look like and function.",Lidl
15,"They have updated this supermarket made it bigger. It's clean easy to access. Just inside the door, you can get takeaway coffees etc very reasonable. There are children's trolleys there so it makes it a family affair. Fresh bread. All types of bread even gluten-free",Lidl
16,As someone else said the place is limited stock wise due to its size. Can be awkward to get around the place as soon as it‚Äôs half busy,Lidl
17,"Great shop, good deals, good prices, good selection, good parking,  friendly atmosphere.    Worth a visit.",Lidl
18,"Fresh bread at the bakery. Great selection of breads, buns & cookies. They have a coffee machine too. One of the larger Lidl stores. Which means a larger selection of the product I want. It's a very busy store so expect queues. Plenty of staff to cope with the demand.",Lidl
19,It's got everything and if they are expanding so many new sectors I also love the changing stock too it moves with the season you find yourself picking up everything. Love the flowers and bakery. It is so many shops in one and the price is great,Lidl
20,Why is there no self service tills have to queue for 10 minutes for 1 thing every single time you go in,Lidl
21,Fine. To me bit like Tesco express. Don't have all the things every week which is frustrating. Staff are lovely. Set up of shop üëé just middle isles are messy when looking. ‚Ä¶,Lidl
22,I so far have generally positive experience about my shopping experience here. The products are quite nice. The rating is for frozen chicken wings (mild spicy). I normally buy spicy chicken wings and they have been ok. This chicken wasn't cooked well and was cooked only on the exterior. The interior was undercooked and quite raw. Hope the store raise the issue with the Lidl quality control dep.,Lidl
23,All staff friendly and patient with elderly. The manager Steven excellent at his job . He has the   perfect manner and obviously has great staff quality a good balance . And acknowledge ever customer.,Lidl
24,"Has Gone DOWN Quite POORLY in Standard already and a EXTREMELY RUDE IGNORANT BLONDE FEMALE MANAGER IN HER THIRTIES,  not Helpful or Polite in anyway.. Horrible customer service wont be back.",Lidl
25,"Lidl‚Äôs popularity will be it‚Äôs downfall. Time and time again I‚Äôve gone into numerous stores to pickup some bits to make a dinner. Around 7pm usually, always to find all the veg is sold out, and I have to take a trip to Tesco. Why are your shelves always bare? I understand of course people buy stuff and you need to restock, my problem is theres no restock happening during the day because the staff is constantly jumping from till to shelve stocking back to till for the entire day. You need to assign someone to restock throughout the day, and enough people to manage the till. Thanks..! üò¥",Lidl
26,"Two tills open, forty people waiting, had to go past twenty other people to ask sour a faced checkout girl to call some of her colleagues to open more tills. Are management even aware of this sort of thing, if they are and find it acceptable they should be replaced and retrained. Spent nearly half an hour in there to get two crossiants.",Lidl
27,"Reasonable prices, friendly staff. With the exception of a few ingredients (e.g. fresh yeast, specific types of tea) we do most of our shopping here. Long opening hours are a bonus.",Lidl
28,"Good stores, but, checkouts are always closed, and queues are very likely, even when not busy. Worse when your getting 3 or 4 items. Big letdown. They spend more time opening and closing checkouts",Lidl
29,"Lots of Polish staff. Friendly and helpful. Parking is mostly occupied on weekends and often best offers are bought by Saturday 1PM (especially wine and beer with discount). Particularly empty shelves on rainy weekends, but I could say that about any Irish supermarket I guess. Next to the shop (to the left like 100mt) there is a children playground with swings and climbing frames (for kids to wait)",Lidl
30,"Management treats staff very bad!
The management is very rude, there are nobody to communicate issues with except area managers and they just dont care, they fob you off and become defensive when you communicate about issues you may have.
It can be very belittling towards younger or quieter people almost as far as bullying i would say...no future for anyone with a desire to earn enough money to get a mortgage etc.",Lidl
31,"Selection of items is so poor that it is even annoying. They have a lot different types of junk food and bare selection of normal food. No organic eggs, their wholemeal bread is impossible to eat. Fruits and vegetables are good quality at least. Tip for store manager: get rid of those 3 lanes of junk food and maybe consider to stock something that does not cause cancer.",Lidl
32,"Rude staff, asked for manager(James) and was told he wasn't there even though he was because I seen him. I demanded to talk to him and when he came out he really didn't care what I was saying. I was calm and descriptive and no matter what I said it went over his head. I was embarrassed shopping here and they honestly didn't care. I do my weekly shopping here and was at least expecting a response from management when I informed him how rude his employee was. I won't be returning.",Lidl
33,"It's a poky little local Lidl. Selection significantly smaller than other branches and tends to be in disarray with stuff strewn around the place. Very hard to manoeuvre the large trolleys around the small shop. Queues tend to be long because most of the time only 2 or max 3 tills are open. It's best for picking up a few small bits and pieces, not doing a huge shopping trip.",Lidl
34,"While a local staple, the area around it and the population have grown, as well as it's popularity, while the shop's small-ish size means the interior is smaller than newer Lidl and the queues can be quite long. However these are the only complaints I have, and the staff and store are reliable and clean. Friendly manners, too.",Lidl
35,"Tuesday night is Autism night here ,low lights and quiet atmosphere.great refurbishment on the store plenty of space ,much brighter and aerier  great new layout.lots of new items in store ,Helpful friendly üòÄ staff. ‚Ä¶",Lidl
36,"Would have been five star but bought a dungarees that was poorly made and I my debit card was also stolen in a lid store. Apart from it, the store offers amazing quality on an affordable price. Always look out for their special buy. Good store to buy your grocery",Lidl
37,Great shop.  Fabulous affordable bakery/ breads/pastries.  Well laid out with lots of choices in cold meats/ fish/poultry.  The same in their fresh foods.  Great value. .,Lidl
38,"What can you say about Lidl? ""Does exactly what it says on the tin!"" Stocked mostly with unknown brands, prices are typically half of what you'd pay in some mainstream supermarkets. But there's no compromise on product quality. Ketchup still tastes good if it's not Heinz. Products are stacked on shelves in their original boxes from the wholesaler. Hap hazard from week to week whether a product is in stock or not. And then there's always the ""gadget isles"". Treat yourself to a new angle grinder, or set of axle stands, dumbbells, his and hers hiking pants or even a compressor....... for those of you who remember The Generation Game..... ""Let's see what's on the conveyor belt this week""...... And every so often, conveyor belts themselves will be on sale!",Lidl
39,"Shopping in Lidl because I don't have any other option nearby, very limited catalog of products. I went to Dunnes recently and enjoyed very much picking my favs among the many options available. Lidl is not as cheap as it looks like. It's a very useful supermarket for grabbing things on the go. Reasonable quality. The worse: cashier area has no space for the client to gather the products after paying them so you have to quickly get it all in your bag or trolley if you don't want to mess it up. I hate this. Pros: workers are usually very kind.",Lidl
40,They have the perfect lean mince. Fab for home made burgers Sheppards pie and much more . Tastes like pure steak. I wouldn't buy it anywhere else ... amazing .,Lidl
41,This Lidl is recently renovated and is larger than a typical store. I do a weekly shop for 6 and can pretty much get all I need under one roof. Fine big carpark and there's a chemist as part of the complex. Helpful?  Please Like.,Lidl
42,Really bad customer service experience this morning. Cashier walked away from till as we arrived without saying anything.. eventually arrived back and never even apologised for leaving. Scanned groceries without a word or a smile and never even made eye contact throughout. Didn't even say how much the bill was ... not an ounce of personal contact in the whole transaction. Couldn't say rude as there was no interaction but if it was a machine I was dealing with I probably would have left less dissapointed. Not the service I am used to from lidl.,Lidl
43,Bargains can be found on regular items and they get various unusual items as a once off that vary each week. Not as much choice if you're vegan or vegetarian.,Lidl
44,"One till open, 3 closed. that's the norm here. I come for the toiletries and kitchen stuff coffee, tea bags and anything else I need will be cheaper than the usual supermarket's. decent prices make it worthwhile",Lidl
45,"Best Lidl in Ireland. The staff are always nice and friendly, which is a welcome surprise in a country with generally terrible customer service.

Also, it might be a smaller Lidl, but always seems to be well stocked, well organised and tidy.",Lidl
46,"Hi,

I was shopping in the Baldoyle store today, 27th July at 3pm which is the store I shop at least twice a week.

However today a new security guard in store decided to follow me up and down the lanes while I did my shopping.  He repeatedly looked into my basket as he passed by me and stood beside me as I gathered items from the shelves and placed into my shopping basket.

I found it very intimidating and I am really considering shopping elsewhere after this incident.

I never experienced this before, in this shop or any other shop so I would like to know what the reasoning is for this over the top approach?

I understand they have a job to do but surely nearly escorting a customer and standing beside them in every lane watching them and what‚Äôs in their basket is very extreme?

As I made my way to the check out he stood there watching me until I paid for my shopping and proceeded to leave the shop he finally went back to doing his job!",Lidl
47,"One of the largest Lidl store I've seen. Everything is brand new after recent refurbishment, and there is few extra things like coffee/ tea machine. Free carpark with very wide parking spots.",Lidl
48,"I shop here at least once a week, always great value.
And now with the shop having been renovated it's so much better",Lidl
49,"Nicely laid out Lidl, recently done up. Avoid at all costs during the BBQ season due to many many many Dubliner flocking to Marley park with their little darlings.

Generally well stocked and pleasant staff.",Lidl
50,"Very cheap, looks like every other lidil/aldi and is in a good location. It has a large selection of fresh fruits and vegetables for quite low prices. When you walk into the building it has a large number of different foods starting with the vegetables and fruits, then it leads on to the frozen Sections at the back of the shop, the next row has lots of sweet and unhealthy foods then there is the isle for toiletries and after that there is the section for wine and alcohol. There is also a large section for every day appliances that very greatly from shower heads to cooking trays they have a lot.",Lidl
51,"Pretty similar to most Lidl stores, with same familiar layout. Has a good range of fresh and frozen stock, plus the middle aisle.",Lidl
52,"Love this spacious Lidl located next to Marlay park. Its huge with plenty of choice for produce. They have freshly baked goods instore, coffee machines. I have always great choice if fresh vegetables,fruits,meat,fish. They have household items. Due to summer approaching latest they had outdoor furniture,gardening stuff.",Lidl
53,"Lidl in Marley, Rathfarnham was good. Plenty of accessible parking, even though looking at the signage I initially turned down the wrong road to access it. Large car park is entranced by a small entrance that seems to belong to a small Centra. Whatever, the Lidl was as good as any of them, nice modern shop, good stock etc....",Lidl
54,Excellent job on the revamped store. Very well run  and the staff are great.,Lidl
55,"Medium sized. You would get most of the usual grocery items. However, in my experience, I have found certain fruits and vegetables to be out of stock too often. Just coincidence?!",Lidl
56,It was my first class this morning.  Enjoy every second of it.  Great care given by the instructor.  Looking forward to my Thursday class.,Lidl
57,"2021: Lidl Baldoyle just finished a several-month revamp Dec 2021 and is now much bigger with the full range of food and middle aisle items. The new bakery is top notch.

2017: Cheap supermarket but due to its medium size it doesn't have the full range of products of a large Lidl",Lidl
58,"Got a bargain today lads...kettle BBQ for ‚Ç¨7.99....priceless.
Sun is coming this weekend as well...so I'm planning a head for a good BBQ weekend!!",Lidl
59,Dreadful .... aisles very narrow. Store is dirty and unkept looking in fact filthy . Definitely won't go back ...Portmarnock store spotless .So now have to drive further distance if I want to shop in Lidl,Lidl
60,"A fine shopping place with a big refurb completed. Great selection of stock, polite and efficient staff and good parking.  Good value.",Lidl
61,Exceptional customer service. Great selection. Thank you to the helpful staff especially the store Security Professionals.,Lidl
62,"Personnel is always nice, prices are classic as in every Lidl but the store space is a bit older so it doesn't look the nicest. Other than that everything is more than good üòÑ ‚Ä¶",Lidl
63,The staff are so friendly in the Baldoyle store. Lidl stocks mainly quality food at cheaper prices. I love the 49c specials. Fruit and vegetables are good quality. Worth a shopping trip,Lidl
64,Have just returned from visit and shopping in Lldls Grange Road Rathfarnham and could not speak more highly of the young man who dealt with me at the checkout.  Unfortunately I do not know his name but sounded Italian and about 19  to 21 perhaps. He was so efficient charming and excellent at his job. Muriel Powell,Lidl
65,It has a good range of products. Staff are very friendly and helpful. And the prices are very low. Also it has a decent car park area.,Lidl
66,"Need signage for product on ceilings hanging down denoting what in the aisles. Eg   dairy, frozen foods, etc Very confusing still even with new shop referb. Also alwYs more than one till open needed. Seems to be always one when i shop.",Lidl
67,My shopping I do always in Lidl Ireland I  happy with service and helpfulness and there politeness and the satisfaction of reasonable prices. Thank You Staff at lidl.,Lidl
68,Always get what I want for a reasonable price but you take your life in your hands when you are parking!  No system in place so it's an absolute free for all.,Lidl
69,"It's a good store with too much business.This leads to frequent out of stocks which,is very frustrating and means one has to go elsewhere to complete the shop. No doubt when the new store opens in Portmarnock later in the year this will help the problem",Lidl
70,"Standard Lidl, not as big as others.",Lidl
71,Nothing in stock as per usual and that 1 staff member that does evening is rude and has no patience,Lidl
72,"Old facility, most of the time things out of stock, weekend deals(wine and beer) often gone before 1 pm, queues pretty often as well... I think that is worse Lidl shop in North Dublin!",Lidl

77,"I do most of my shopping in Lidl but have found recently that quality of oranges is very poor. From a bunch of 5, one will be unusable.",Lidl
78,Spaces store with ever expanding range of new products. Probably the best supermarket around the area. Excellent shopping experience and of course great value for money!,Lidl
79,Miserable place to be honest. Staff talking in their own language to each other.  Lots of que jumping when new till opens.,Lidl
80,Beautiful new shop but they seem to have stock issues  with certain products,Lidl
81,"Just an average Lidl. No special frills here. Cheap stuff like all Lidls. Staff is average just like all Lidls. Parking lot is has always been a nightmare, so good luck with that.",Lidl
82,"it is a fact that if LIDL and ALDI never came to Ireland we would still spend an average 150/200 euro weekly shopping
They literally changed the game plan of supermarkets to our benefit and LIDL grange Road has an excellent staff",Lidl
83,"This Lidl is the nearest shop to me and what a waste of space and waste of my valuable time shopping here, they never have any of the products I  wish to purchase. The labels are there ....just empty space, my stress levels rise and when I  ask .....anymore in stock .....no, not till tomorrow, I will ge going elsewhere from now on. I can not wait for the Aldi to open in Bayside, superior every time.......so no ....I don't rate this shop!",Lidl
84,Excellent very clean and well stocked store staff were very friendly helpful and courteous will definitely return,Lidl
85,The prices are cheap but the fruit never lasts past a day or two and it's missing a lot of key items. Also it's the only place where they put the price above the items instead of below it and it's really confusing.,Lidl
86,"One of the smaller stores.  Carries great selection of fresh fruit and veg, meat and fish, fresh baked goods also good.  But don't rely on finding everything",Lidl
87,Lidl was very disappointing today  ...u walk in and there is this smell of rubbish bins which I now realise was rotting food as I came  across rotten mushrooms rotten strawberries which are left on the shelves to be sold ....disgusting....no where to park ...no bags to but only freezer bags to pack my groceries so I will not be retuning here again. It's not all lidls as I know nutgrove and Ballycullen are not like this at all! You need to get your shop sorted out or you will not have alot of satisfied customers!,Lidl
88,"Great shop, great prices and the staff are lovely and helpful no matter what time if the day you visit love this store",Lidl
89,"the new remake and move i dont see the point. the shop is smaller or seems that way cause some isles are smaller, the pet food isle is so much smaller. it was better before they moved the store.  seriously what the heck was the point of this move?",Lidl
90,"Fantastic revamp job, and the ostrich meat you stocked over Christmas was a pure delicious üòã ‚Ä¶",Lidl
91,Bigger than average Lidl with bakery fresh bread. Good space inside. Big selection of groceries. Ground level car park. Near Marlay park.,Lidl
92,"Standard busy Lidl, nice and spacious too. Would be nice if there were bike racks near the entrance however.",Lidl
93,Good for the area. Store much better since capex. Staff lovely.,Lidl
94,This Lidl in my opinion is better than the Lidl in portmarnock since they refurbished it and also better than Aldi in Bayside. Always well stocked too!,Lidl
95,It's one of smallest branches so special offers sell out quickly.but. Staff are v friendly and helpful,Lidl
96,"Lidl's shops are all the same,  some bigger than others.  The prices and value don't vary. So you usually find what you're looking for. Where ever you are.  Comforting  !!",Lidl

1,"I love this shop, Lidl's always have so much more to offer than Aldi's, as a wheelchair user, independently getting out and about in my scooter, there is always plenty of room for me to get around in the shop, apart from all these new fridges that most supermarkets have now installed, which is a nightmare for us wheelchair users, but as always people are ready to help when we need it most. I always give a smile button a press when I leave the store üòÅüëç",Lidl
2,New manager Raquel is so rude with no manners whatsoever‚Ä¶ Disgusted behaviour. I love Lidl in Balbriggan and it‚Äôs a shame you‚Äôve such person on board,Lidl
3,"I generally have a positive experience with Lidl, but the BALBRIGGAN store are thieves , I have bought things on 30 percent discount and the Lidl Plus app but when I got home to check the receipt NONE of the discounts were applied, neither from the lidl plus app or the 30% discount on selected goods. THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS, beware and always check that discounts are applied because they never manage to apply them.",Lidl
4,"Good selection of products, staff always friendly.",Lidl
5,Great products and quality always. Strongly recommended for week shopping. And sometimes have leisure products too!,Lidl
6,Handy to have around the corner. Can‚Äôt complain about quality or availability. Staff always friendly.,Lidl
7,"Hello.  I would like to make a complaint against one of our staff named Lyubov who works at the counter in a shop located in Balbriggan.  Today while shopping, at the checkout she accused me that the bag in which I pack my groceries is stolen. Then I explained to her that the bag is mine and if she doesn't believe me, let her check the cameras.  Then she started racistly making fun of me and mocking me.  I am very sorry that I had to experience such treatment. Please talk to the above-mentioned employee so that she does not treat anyone else in this way.  In my opinion, this is unacceptable.  Thank you",Lidl
8,"Great store. Very well stocked, items at competitive prices, very affordable. Amazing sales on not only food but also home, garden and even outdoor items. Friendly and helpful staff makes it even better.",Lidl
9,"Great selection of food and fast service...  Happy to shop there... in May they have some great  garden shrubs  and ü™¥.

Best time to shop on weekends is Sunday morning.  Have started to see staff applying discounts to products on Sunday!!",Lidl
10,"Store is just about OK, not so modern compared to other Lidl stores. Staff are quite rude, each time they try say I'm trying to steal the basket. It used to be that you pack your bag on the shelf and I still do that but it seems they have a problem with that.",Lidl
11,"There can never be any doubt that Lidl is considerably cheaper than other supermarkets.  For example prepared pineapple is around ‚Ç¨2 in most supermarkets but in Lidl it's around ‚Ç¨1.70 I know it's only 30c but you are saving around 20 or 30c per item compared to other shops so adding those savings means our normal weekly shop is around ‚Ç¨20 or ‚Ç¨30 cheaper.  We got an invisible aerosol sunblock for ‚Ç¨3.99 yesterday! You can't beat that!

We would go only occasionally though as it's a bit difficult for us to haul our shopping home due to ill health.  I so wish they did a home delivery service.  I'd say they would have a huge uptake in custom.",Lidl
12,"I bought the 3 euro box of fruit and veg. It contained blueberries, 4 carrots, 4 peppers, a melon (badly bruised), 3 passion fruits, a cucumber and 5.7kilos of bananas. The bananas went into the compost bin! They were mush!!!!",Lidl
13,"Great fresh produce, exellent selection, great own brand ranges such as the XXL and Delux range, fab bakery, great selwction no matter your budget, always clean and tidy, value for money can not be beaten for the quality of products in my opinion. Would totally 100% be a 5 stars but for one thing actually wish I could give 4 1/2 as 99% of staff are friendly, helpful, polite and I can not fault them and normally I'd leave it at that but the rude attitude I receive off one certain female staff member just really lets it down for me, 1st time I chalked it down to a bad day even though she shouted at me, rolled her eyes, bacame confrontational, swore under her breath made such an embarrassing scene a manager approached to find out the issue, the manager sent her away while she spoke to me as the employee couldn't control herself and continued to shout, abuse and disrespect me from about 10 feet away in the presence of the manager. I got tiered of the back and forth so let it go paid for my shopping and left. I went back many times since and whenever this lady was on the till i avoided that checkout until one evening it was the last one open so I had no option, I greeted her as I would anyone else only for her to roll her eyes, my shopping was practically thrown at me and when it came to paying I said I'd pay cash which seemed to displease her, I also heard her speak about me in a dirogitary way through her headpiece and I had my change and receipt thrown at me. I was so upset as this was now my 3rd or 4th run in with this lady I now avoid Lidl as much as possible which is a shame as I shopped there between 2-4 times a week usually on a Tuesday and Friday, I now use Tesco and only use lidl if I've no choice which is a real shame for many reasons 1. It's really close to home 2. It's amazing value for money 3. The products and fresh produce are of a high-quality 4. The majority of staff are amazing and to be 100% honest after the first incident I would have chalked it up to a bad day despite the gravity of the situation but for the fact the employee carried on her rude, obnoxious and confrontational behaviour in the presence of her manager showed me she had no fear of repercussions and furthermore continued her rudeness to me on multiple occasions in the months afterwards showed me she had not been reprimanded for her unprofessional behaviour. I understood the manager not doing so while I was there but I would have expected some sort of repercussions for the level of intimidation and confrontational behaviour. I've worked in customer services and have managed companies before admittedly not a supermarket but basic customer service crosses all industries and I find it such a shame because I am now uncomfortable to shop there when I know this particular lady is working. So over all wonderful shop and staff but it just takes one bad Apple to spoil the lot especially when it I allowed to go unpunished. Apologies as I hate given a bad review when the majority of my experiences are pleasant.",Lidl
14,"One of my favourite shopping places and somewhere you'll find me weekly. You'll get more for less and great tools and electrical ware, got a great toaster lately and a hands free opening bin ‚Ç¨40.00 cheaper than in another big named electrical shop.",Lidl
15,"Lidl Balbriggan is best as they come! Staff are highly professional,  always helpful and friendly. Something you can hardly say regarding other leading supermarkets in Balbriggan. Food is always fresh and the little bakery section is just lovely. I've been a customer for over 10 years and I'm delighted to see the shop's improvement as time goes by",Lidl
16,"Crowded, kids running around with parents not bothered. Prices seem to be creeping up as cant see quantity in ‚Ç¨70 spent, disappointed , others have also said same they see  less value lately",Lidl
17,"If i could give a 0 i would.Worst customer service i have ever seen your staff couldnt give a crap about customers. Was in your store today asked one of your employees were i could find an item all i got was ""it out of stock"" your one didnt bother turning her head to look at me nothing just kept slamming boxes on the floor. Rather go to tescos foods better quality, more of a selection, and the STAFF are very helpful. So wont be back! Thanks.!",Lidl
18,"I love 'my' Lidl, especially since they introduced the new shelves. The staff are always very friendly and helpful, the prices slightly cheaper than in other supermarkets and you can even buy some organic food at reasonable prices. However, I still have given Lidl only 3 stars, because a lot of the time, items that used to be there are suddenly missing. Sold out? Not gotten enough stock in? I don't know. It doesn't seem to happen in other supermarkets. And the other missing Star is for the fact that the checkouts always seem to be  closing. Only a third of them seem to be operating. I don't understand the policy behind it...nevertheless, if you have time to wait at the checkouts and a backup plan for what to cook if the item you needed is missing, then it's a good place to do your shopping.",Lidl
19,This is my favourite shop... You can find nearly anything...,Lidl
20,As usual bought more than planned. üòÅRemoving one üí´ for not getting W5 Max Power Cleaner (on the photo). Lidl please bring this item back to stock. Can't get this anywhere. üò≠ ‚Ä¶,Lidl
21,"Great products, great prices. Lots of parking.
Would have given 5 stars if staff smiled more and were polite.",Lidl
22,Love shopping here great variety of products,Lidl
23,Terrible we experience in Balbriggan today. Why do staff rush you on check out ? Items where been scanned and pushed on to me too quickly one item falls and smashed all over the place Greek yogurt everywhere. Don't like this feeling in any of these stores.,Lidl
24,"Shop is okay - it's Lidl...it does exactly as it's supposed to.
My 2 big criticisms are - (1) it always looks untidy - I know that's more from untidy customers - but I still find it very off putting and (2) the queues at the tills are unnecessary - I only ever have 2 to 5 items but am always stuck behind people with larger baskets/trolleys - it's nearly 2022 - I fail to see why there are not self-service tills in the store.
Update @ 24/02/2022 = called to the store to buy a couple of items - again - still queues at the tills. I really can't understand why they won't install self-service checkouts.",Lidl
25,"Can't really go wrong with a Lidl. Well laid out, well stocked, would recommend going in as early as possible as the tills can be bedlam when busy. Arrived at 9am today, very quiet, a week's shopping done in 15mins.",Lidl
26,"Was a bit disappointed when I came to the shop today and was looking forward to Greek week, to find that special isles/freezers were not stocked at all. If advertised that Greek week starts on a Monday, it would be good practice to ensure shop is stocked as advertised.",Lidl
27,"Their bakery section is amazing especially they're toffee yum yum.
Their chocolate crisp cereal is exceptional.
Their cookie dough ice cream let me not even stArt & their German section greatttt",Lidl
28,The value and savings are huge. Quality is very good on most products. Highly recommended! As good as ever if not better.,Lidl
29,"Nice, beautiful people working there",Lidl
30,Great prices and selection. The staff (most of them) are very helpful and pleasant. My favourite place to shop.,Lidl
31,"Only 2 stars for the customer service/cashier staff, I've had unpleasant experiences with some of them and they should be trained to be nicer and more helpful in a positive not shouting kind of way",Lidl
32,Has good range of products but the price tags are a bit confusing. Friendly staff. Taking good precautions during covid-19 crisis. Has good parking space.,Lidl
33,Good high quality food at low prices and a big problem I find is. They run out of products very quick and it takes weeks before they stock them again.,Lidl
34,As usual cheaper compared to other retailer in Balbriggan. The way it is set up is not that convenient and very difficult to find products. Well when you are used to shop every 2-3 weeks the impact will be there. Otherwise staff friendly and helpful as always.,Lidl
35,Would be  lost with out it decent good at very good prices . I only left a star off because 90% The staff are foreign and can't understand what you are saying if you need to ask a question about a product or deals or whatever the case may be,Lidl
36,Great shop staff on point. Had some issues in the past but now rectified. Still a good place to shop. Inflammation is slowly creeping into lidl aswell.,Lidl

44,Lidl and their different range of products scores many points.,Lidl
45,"Ok Lidl.
Dislike that they often change things around which leaves you walking all over to find what you need.
Also general issue with some items being out of stock for long and staff not knowledgeable about many things. Overall needs to improve on Customer Service and Stocking up.",Lidl
46,"saw a chicken fillet go flying across an isle and hit a child.

47,"I have just come from your store in Balbriggan and there is absolutely no social distancing being observed, despite it being extremely crowded. Just like a ""normal"" day. No management of people entering the shop either. This belies your advertisements on TV.",Lidl
48,"Constantly understaffed.

Clean your baskets please, always filthy and full of dirt.

Bakery tongs always encrusted, please clean them, it's disgusting.

UPDATE 4 MONTHS LATER

Baskets still disgustingly filthy, clearly dirty baskets don't bother Lidl management. I have enough choice, that I don't need to shop somewhere with poor standards in hygiene.",Lidl
49,"Typical Lidl, not much to say, but the stock levels are always awful.

As much I understand they don't want to have to much fresh stuff what nobody buy in the end of the day, I still urge them to reconsider when it comes o meat (in particular chicken and special offers) and sometimes fruits as well.

Apart from tht the Lidl is good. Enough space to offer full portfolio and big enough car park for Balbriggan",Lidl

1,"This place is awesome, there is always something that jumps out at you, prices are more expensive than I thought they would be, but you can always pick up a good bargain. Staff are very helpful, I'm a wheelchair user, and as all supermarkets have these new standing closed fridges  it can be very difficult to keep the fridge door open in order to get what you want, but there is always a helpful member of staff or some friendly shopper to help",Lidl
2,Lidl is way better than other stores. They have lot of offers on food and veggies. Fruits are also of good quality here. We like milk which we get from Lidl. Also the curd is really good. Natural Greek style yoghurt which comes in a pack of 1kg. It's really good.,Lidl
3,"Rubber stamped Lidl
Good size, has not seen the new facelift that stores are getting to make them all look the same.
Staff were super friendly and helpful.
It's Lidl folks, seen one seen them all.
Good value products and the fresh fruit always only lasts a short time and you definitely take a rotten one in the mix. Lol",Lidl
4,"Great store that‚Äôs well stocked and has good value for money.  Staff are very hard working but sometimes seem like they dont want to be bothered by customers as they are so busy.

The phone network signal half way down the shop gets blocked which is a real pain when you are trying to use the Lidl app.  Coffee machine is good value but not always working.

Plenty of parking and trolleys but the baskets could be cleaner.",Lidl
5,"Staff are friendly, efficient, and polite. There are plenty of good value food and drink items available.
The Lidl plus app is a must as it provides great value when shopping with any Lidl store.
The bakery could be kept better stocked throughout the day, but is very well stocked in the mornings.
Spacious free car park which is fully lit at night-time.",Lidl
6,"The sales assistants are always nice. But the new manager is a disaster.First time he was on the till and I almost blocked my card he was really rude. Then I realized the card machine take first number twice , I told him . No sorry nothing came. Then today I was looking forward to get the frozen American things it should be in today , nothing in the freezer. Went to the same manager( young male) and I asked for it. He said no maybe  tomorrow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. It should be in today but still no I don‚Äôt have time maybe tomorrow. Seriously‚Ä¶. Really sad that the manager put the shop so down ;(.",Lidl
7,"Very shocked this evening at 20.16 by the absolute rudeness of a member of staff in Ashbourne. I shop all the time here and have never experienced a staff member being so rude. It was at Till 1. Time stated above when I went into shop with my grandson to get him a treat. Staff member shouted at us 2 meter's apart which we were. No need for that. Never even said excuse me or thank you. Just banged our change on counter. I know and appreciate people get tired and I don't want to get anyone in trouble. But please in front of child show manner's and kindness, after all how do you want people to react to you if you behave in a bad manner.",Lidl
8,"Convenient, Value for money weekly shopping. It's a place where you can shop for bulk shopping for big families and once a week shoppers. Also a Good selections and better value liquor store. Staff good. No long delays at counters. Clean and organised. Big car park with wheelchair parking. Shop is wheelchair friendly too. Also children friendly. But sadly I see some parents are abusing it by letting children running and shouting.",Lidl
9,Great price and quality,Lidl
10,"Shocking customer experience today at 8.00 p m at the middle cash desk. Rude, unfriendly sales assistant who displayed blatant indifference to customer needs. I had 2 loose carrots which she said she can't scan as they sold in bunches  When I pointed out all the trouble I have to go through just to get the bunch of carrots and queque again , she said nothing she can do. I said that is disgraceful attitude and at least she could have offered someone to help to grab carrots,  she said I should be nicer about it.Shocking. sarcastically",Lidl
11,"A good supermarket with lots of fresh produce, always clean and welcoming with a massive selection of fresh baked breads and pastries and of course huge fresh fruit and vegetable display.",Lidl
12,I had a fantastic time with my 9 sisters and 2 brothers especially in the vegetable section. After two hours of feeling as much vegetables as possible we moved onto the dairy section where we felt everything also. We decided on a packet of cotton buds as our dear mother has waxy ears. We high-five  Lidl all eleven of us. Dad prefers Aldi.,Lidl
13,"The reason why I am giving 2 stars is because their checkout service is so slow I was 10 minutes in the queue and they only had 2 checkouts open when there are 6 available.

I believe his name was Norbert I had a long shopping list and i was looking around in a ""lost""manner and he approached me and enquired if i needed help to find something i told him i was looking for gravy granules. He told me where to go and i made a point of coming back to where he was unloading a pallet. I told that in all the years i have been shopping with Lidl in all different branches this was the first ever that a member of staff approached me rather than the other way around it was so refreshing and so welcome. I felt that i was duty bound to inform you that in Norbert you have a very pleasant and important member of staff. I do most of my shopping in the Kinsale branch and i commend you on your staff there as well. Wishing Lidl continued success for the future and my good wishes to Norbert and all your staff for Christmas and the New Year.       Patrick Power",Lidl
