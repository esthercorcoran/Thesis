1,Aldi's generally receives positive reviews for its reasonable prices. Shoppers often appreciate the value for money and cost-effective options available at Aldi. This aldi also has spacious car parking,Aldi
2,"Well laid out shop. Good selection of  foods, fresh vegetables, meats and frozen food. Nice items in the middle isle.",Aldi
3,"Good store. The problem with some of these discount retailers is that they're often not adequately stocked with fresh food. But this Aldi is fairly well stocked. Lidl across the road is much worse. Also tends to be well staffed queues not long, polite staff. Good parking.",Aldi
4,"Super-fantastic!!!! 💖💕💞💖💕💞
Very good products, wide range, affordable prices!
Giant melon is so delicious, very tasty drinking joghurt. I am very very satisfied!
Definetely go back soon!
💖💕💞💖💕💞",Aldi
5,The quality of meat at Aldi doesn't looks well inside of the bits.  You can't be sure that you buy there a good food.,Aldi
6,"A lot of food variety, pots and tools. So cheap! Recommend it. They have great houmous as well.",Aldi
7,Lately stock not coming in. Marzepein bites sold out since 1st week of December. No tubs of Roses. Staff alway helpfull,Aldi
8,Thia store has improved a lot over time. Prices are good. They won me back.,Aldi
9,Good and fast service and helpful staff ready to help you if you need it,Aldi
10,Love these stores. Great products. Great pocket friendly prices...,Aldi
11,As usual. The saviour to the rescue with cheap everything but great quality. While everywhere else here in Dublin is incredibly unaffordable with the exception of a few. Thank you for enabling us to survive!,Aldi
12,Only go for the middle aile but always walk out with something food wise,Aldi
13,"Great food
With no price discounts or B S h  1 t , just good value 99% of the Time",Aldi
14,Lidl is much better. Check outs are not efficient and staff standing around chatting. Will go to the Lidl across the road in future.. Express check in Lidl is brilliant.,Aldi
15,They male staff are very unhelpful  and rude. I asked a member of staff to help me because bleach spilled all over my groceries and he looked at me and walked away.  There was a very helpful young lady who did help me thou. I will never go back to that store,Aldi
16,"Good place to shop, I was nearby, handy parking, opposite road is another grocery store, if you need",Aldi
17,Good shop. BUT there are no self service checkouts. There are 6 Checkouts (Never I have I seen all 6 open) But absolutely nothing for people with only a few items. Why not add in some self checkouts ?  That's why I head across the road to Lidl who does have self checkouts.,Aldi
18,Always love shopping in Aldi as they have a good range of organic products and many vegan options 😉 …,Aldi
19,"Need to be extra careful if you are foreigner or If you are visiting, criminals are about in car parks to rob you of your belongings. Criminals  choose foreign registration cars!",Aldi
20,Great helpfull staff always.,Aldi
21,"Lots of out of stocks lately, their prices have risen more than Lidl's for the same products, they don't get enough of the popular specialbuys items or the don't come in at all. An Irish short mid-late 30s female employee is rude and lazy, she needs to sort her attitude problem.",Aldi
22,"Our regular weekend shopping, food is not getting cheaper but you can save yourself a few bob by getting what you need without the added label price..",Aldi
23,Good spot to do a shopping,Aldi
24,Having a great time helping who I can when I can,Aldi
25,First time in an Ireland Aldi....something to get use too...great selection though.,Aldi
26,Great supermarket with a good range at a good price. You do need to get used to what's on offer and go knowing what to expect. They sell tasty produce at very reasonable prices. I do wish they used less plastic in their fruit and veg section!,Aldi
27,A lot of the staff here are extremely rude and very bad at customer service. Some of them have a terrible attitude and others don't even greet the customer when Scanning as they're too busy involved in laughing and joking whatever personal conversions they're having with the head pieces on to other staff,Aldi
28,Pleasant shopping experience. Had everything I needed. Staff were polite and friendly. 4 stars because they don't give you much time to gather your shopping before scanning the next customer.,Aldi
29,"Very easy to get to from Grand Canal, and worth the walk. Staff was helpful and good selection and prices. Got all of this for €39!  Wish there was a bit more selection of fresh produce and chicken but  may have just been  low on stock this day.",Aldi
30,In my opinion the best supermarket in Ireland. The quality of food is the best and the selection is precious. I am so happy I have their shop close to home. My diet is now much better THAN BEFORE ONLY because of Aldi. And I am deadly serious on these things. I care a lot about what I eat.,Aldi
31,Great value and great staff. It has a very convenient car park.  I would highly recommend Aldi for families for value and quality.,Aldi
32,"Good quality products, the cheapest supermarket prices in Dublin along with Lidl. They have a wide variety of products, with an outstanding middle aisle full of convenient items. Lots of options for imported food as well.",Aldi
33,"Great selection of grocery, amazing value for the money. You can find good selection of veg in very appealing prices. Big selection of local meat and cheeses. For the price you can't find better quality",Aldi
34,A nice full sized Aldi not too far from the city centre. Upholds the Aldi name with fully stocked shelves and biweekly special buys. Plenty of parking and good bike racks outside. As a student I love this place.,Aldi
35,"Good place keeps prices down with cheap tools like lidl, discouraging theives looking for more expensive tools to sell, knowing how scarce prison spaces now days are since Fine Gales Alan Chatere closed down rural Garda stations to redirect funding to asylum centers",Aldi
36,Excelent professionals working here. They are very helpful and have great attention to detail. I am one handed and I've been always asked if I need help with heavy or large items both at the aisles and àt the till.,Aldi
37,Great place to shop.. lovely stress-free staff and robin the manager is so helpful. Can’t wait to see the new set-up... and enjoy my shopping even more.,Aldi
38,"Always very well stocked during weekly specials. Could do with a makeover though, especially given the shiny new Lidl facing it. It feels a bit like it's stuck in the 1980's but sure I'm not looking to live in it eh?",Aldi
39,"I love this aldi but it does be freezing, my mam doesn’t want to go anymore because of this and it’s a nightmare as she has to travel further to the one in rathmines.",Aldi
40,"Very good shop, i love it. They have a lot of good product for very good prices.",Aldi
41,Love Aldi only wish we had them North of the border,Aldi
42,"I had a terrible experience in your East Wall store today.
It’s way too risky to go here.
Never again will I shop in Aldi over Lidl.

No crowd control or management of the situation. The security guard stood upstairs inside the store while customers pushed their way up the escalators.
There was way too many people in the shop. Tills still closed.
The poor staff were trying to pack shelves with people crowded around them.
So dangerous for customers & staff.",Aldi
43,"Great value, i missed coffee for my american coffee maker & parking was a little congested last Saturday Eve. Will start going there as normal store tho due to great value of products and even better cost",Aldi
44,"Parking is available.
Good variety considering the central location.",Aldi
45,"Robin. . So sorry  Mr Quinn from superquin  died as he had what it takes  but I'm very impressed with this store manager Robin in aldi east wall  he was so helpfull with our request to find more solar lights ,he went to the trouble to locate them call us to let us know they would be in in east wall next day and then call us to say they were there. Now that service is exceptional and definitely worth a fantastic review thank you  Robin youre one off the old block and very helpfull and very appreciated",Aldi
46,"While not a pretty supermarket, everything is in boxes unpacked, the deals are certainly worth bypassing this detail. Great quality only quirk is you need 2 euros to use the shopping cart which you get back at the end.",Aldi
47,Almost nothing is original.,Aldi
48,Great food @ reasonable prices. Getting a parking spot & around the shop on particularly busy days can be hell but worth it when you save half the cost,Aldi
49,"Quality of goods is barely acceptable, and the store is rather dirty, I understand that's the general compromise you have to have lower prices, but Lidl on the other side of the road is cheap as well and far more clean and tidy than this shop.",Aldi
50,"Great value shopping. Honesty. If your near the strand firebrigad station. Or Annesley bridge .near Ballybough also. Fair view park (in picture) was taken from Annesley bridge. East wall rd. Is just Right of this photo also. F.v.park. to the left where people Enjoying a glorious sunshine of a day. Around the start of the year. Or so. But a beautiful day."" Suprisling "". Theirs a road. Right to this photo. But just not in shot. Sorry. But next to this waterway is East-wall-Rd. Past under railway bridge. Your there. And I have to tell you that. Companies in Competition. Ouch. I hope that's ok.? But it mite have being a rumour just making it's way around everyone. That listen to gossip. Sometimes. But I need proper proof anyway. But I must say. I enjoyed how mennie Euros I was saving.its very Moden. And caters for all. How ever you get there. When you get to this store. First thing you notice. Is how clean they keep it. Architects gran pease of stunning build.  They have everything you need to have. They have it. And again staff are always willing, with a Smile. To help u kindly fined  something you just can't seem to find. Taking one star away. Just if they had more assistance .on the floor. To help. Would be much appreciated. But great value for money. ALDI. Live a little more. Shopping centre tops it for me. Food. A lot. Very very nice.🇮🇪➕⚘😊👀🤳",Aldi
51,"Had a fainting episode in store today, staff were exceptional in looking after me, brought me a chair, water, sweets etc and put me at ease during quite a stressful experience! Can't thank them enough!",Aldi
52,Probably my favourite Aldi in dublin so far. Its built above the Carparks on ground floor and basement. lifts and escalators to the main shop. Clean and efficient. Good selection of foods typical of Aldi. Can be a bit mental on a Sunday morning as shoppers and staff refilling shelves get in the way of each other.. but I like it,Aldi
53,Car parking a problem in new Swords store would think it's being used by people attending courthouse produce not as good now poor dates etc staff are very nice to deal with but the car parking situation is a turnoff despite e mails to their head office they responded saying they would look into it also spoke with manager who didn't seem that bothered also people using disabled spots without proper permits not managed,Aldi
54,"I would not be a fan of aldi, as have had to occasions when they lack of customer service is not up to standard. Alsi Eastwell lack of parking facilities is inadequate.  I had the experience of my car bring clamped even tho i was not parked in a disabled area. Had  to return my shopping in order to pay clamping fine. Got no satisfaction from management. Also bought a mobile phone which was useless ,contacted Aldi customer service by phone and was told if I had proof of purchase, which I did on my credit card bill, I would get refund,  yet when I returned to Aldi , manager would not refund my money as was out of time limit. In actual fact under consumer act as the goods were faulty I was entitled to full refund . I now only buy few items in aldi.",Aldi
55,"From the lads on security, to the lads on the tills - You guys somehow manage to be in good humour EVERY time! Well done to ye all - and I absolutely love the way you always say hello at checkout. Forget brilliant prices, your people are what makes me shop! See ye in 30 mins btw...!! Thanks Aldi",Aldi
56,A great store without the hassle to worry about parking. Feedback taken on packing the shopping.  Bad experience was the racist polish man and partner in the car park.,Aldi
57,Great place to shop .big value.lots of parking .the only reason I gave 4 stars is the fruit does not last very long after purchase.,Aldi
58,I was only in ALDI once at the start of the pandemic 2 years ago and we all were told to use masks but the majority of people didn't bother so I would never go back to that store again.,Aldi
59,"Large store with plenty of choice at good value, handy underground car park, tho not the easiest place to exit onto main road if going right",Aldi
60,Great discounts. The only problem are the local teenagers riding bikes in the underground car park. The security does seem to be doing anything with this.,Aldi
61,"Staff very Competent and Helpful got a Refund on an article that was not good, but the Assistant was  very quick dealing with  it to my satisfaction and was very pleasant about. Lo I'm",Aldi
62,"Earlier at Aldi, East Wall, Dublin
The 2 mètre distancing is controlled at the entrance, but why nobody in the store to check that people behave the same way?
An ignorant b**** pushed my partner to grab something over him and touching him(did not have gloves on) . When he asked her to keep her distance, she just say F. O.
As there was no manager or security around, he walked away and said nothing in case she would have became more aggressive (like spitting)
Disgraceful behaviour!",Aldi
63,"Always will find something unusual in the middle section that I didn't know I needed. Great offers, and range of products for constantly low cost",Aldi
64,Got some tools great value love going der,Aldi
65,"Big, well stocked Aldi. Plenty of parking and even some bike racks, and now there's a good Lidl right across the road (so you can fulfil all your German supermarket needs in one stop!)",Aldi
66,"Store is fine, till staff are friendly, security guard is incredibly condescending, rude, and picks on people for no obvious reasons. I've seen this a few times. I don't go here anymore because of him.",Aldi
67,Shopped there today and a few people were not wearing masks. I spoke to the security guy who had not been on the door as I had gone in....and his reply was that there was nothing he could do! Could he not have been there and could he not have asked!!!!,Aldi
68,"Good amount of free parking space, and easily accessible store via escalators and a lift. The store is well stocked and staff are nice too.",Aldi
69,"Enough parking space for grocery runs.
They don't replenish the shelves that much between 20:30 and 21:00 in the evenings, so not the best place for late shopping.",Aldi
70,"Why did they make it so frustrating to get in the store itself? Walk in the ground floor, and either take the escalators 2 stories up or one of the two slowest elevators in Dublin.",Aldi
71,East Wall Aldi is always a pleasure to shop in. Being short of stature I sometimes struggle with the height of shelves but there's always a cheery staff member willing to help me fetch something down to me.,Aldi
72,"Great shop,great prices and staff at great help",Aldi

75,"This Aldi suffers from its location because they seem to have less decent stock, less replenishing of stock than, say, Aldi in Deansgrange. I'm calling it as it is lads - our money in East Wall is as good as anywhere else. Stock our Aldi appropriately please.",Aldi

1,"Very shocked as I used to love shopping in this Aldi, then today I'm shocked at the rudeness of not one but two cashier's, they were chatting and chatting to customers and as soon as they seen me walking up, the first till the blonde woman slid the red ""till closed"" bar down the belt, and the same thing happened at the next till. Very rude as then when I went to the only till open, other people filled up the belts that had been closed as I approached. Quite shocked as usually had a very good experience in this Aldi and was a regular customer there but I will think twice in future and just pray that there isn't ignorant staff on the tills.",Aldi
2,"What a great purchasing experience I had today. I visited Aldi to purchase groceries around 7pm. I am very impressed of customer service by casher, whom was positioned close to flower section . I don’t remember casher’s name. But, i like to praise this casher’s customer service. There was quite long queue. She actually checked my purchased products. She found out egg packaging. She was telling me that one of my egg that purchased might be broken as soon as she found out leakage of water on egg package. She opened the egg package and she re-checked.  Even if she was busy to handle many customers, I felt that she was caring customers. Thank you for your service again.😍",Aldi
3,"Unlike the LIDL down the street, which has a couple of manned tills, but doesn't use them, this ALDI has no self-checkouts.
So if you're like me and don't like to use them, this is the place to go 😉 …",Aldi
4,Not as much variety as before... Used to love their perfumes and beauty section but it's now very small. Ditto the bargain section. But still great quality at good prices and friendly staff.,Aldi
5,"In past 2 years visiting this shop I can not find everyday the products I need, many times you go at the fruit stand and are no plastic bags, you go at the meat stand you can not find meat every time. They doing an amaizing hazelnut croissant,  wich I love it but again you dont find it everytime. I tryed to go mornings ,afternoons and evenings. The same thing some shelves are empty. Every Sunday I go in shop, I find out they dont have plastic bags for fruits.  If u try to tell someone in the shop, they will take no action!",Aldi
6,"My Dublin Men
My Dublin is Full Now All Thank You to me Alone Myself 🖤😍❤️🎁☕🥤 …",Aldi
7,They have mostly have daily needs grocery. But there is less variety in some items. Also the billing may take time in rush hours.,Aldi
8,Wide range of goods. Affordable prices. Food very tasty.,Aldi
9,A bit smaller than other Aldi stores but you can find everything there at a cheap price.,Aldi
10,"This Aldi is in a great location as it's right in Dublin City Centre. This is handy when you are already out doing a bit of shopping or running errands in the city centre however that also means it's handy for everyone else so it usually is pretty busy at this location. The staff are lovely and even with the large amount of customers the wait time in queues is not that bad. The only thing I find annoying about this location is due to the heavy amount of traffic coming through here you will find many times deals on offer are sold out much quicker than most other locations. If you are just coming in for a normal shop though and not looking for a specific item on offer this place is perfect. Although again, you might want to avoid peak times like 5-6PM as they do get very busy and the store doesn't have enough time to restock with the large amount of people coming through so the shelves can look a bit empty during these times due to the massive influx of customers. Great shop overall and I frequent here often.",Aldi
11,Good supermarket prices all do dear competitive compared to the test,Aldi
12,"Great value and selection/stock. Friendly staff.
Got new food items and very Happy with value for money 💰
Will be back on a regular basis …",Aldi
13,"Unfortunately a small selection of beer & wine, and at much higher prices than the German Aldi stores I’m accustomed to. Otherwise clean with a good selection of food products.",Aldi
14,You can find things cheaper thannither supermarkets including Lidl,Aldi
15,It's great to shop in and the prices are alot cheaper than any other store and they have great brand I went to dunces cause I got a voucher for 20 euro it half ield my rugsack went to good owl aldi and the bag was full with chicken and mince and a whole lot for 19 87 what a difference in the shopping.,Aldi
16,New to area quite store range is good would love to see a bakery,Aldi
17,Very convenient market I love it!,Aldi
18,"Used to shop here every week but have changed to Lidl now.
Started finding micro plastics in my food, about a month ago inside a jar of pasta sauce and this week underneath the cheese in a pizza!! So food totally not safe! Everytime I go in also noticed food ls gone off too! Increased prices also.
The last time I went in a week ago floors all black streaked and sticky! So unhygienic.
Middle isle (half an isle should I say) is pathetic here and always full of garden stuff, who has a garden in middle of Dublin City Center 😂
The staff are ignorant and scream at customers, the security gaurd sits on his phone all day giving dirty looks to people. The place literally gives me anxiety.

Been delighted by Lidl so far, their app for discounts and their bakery is amazing! They deserve my money.
Goodbye Aldi! 👋",Aldi
19,"Love ALDI, I 100% prefer ALDI to Lidl, they have a much better range & I find there meat/chicken etc is way way better & unfortunately I find with Lidl the meat/chicken (fresh) even when in date it goes off before the use by date & smells, also if you buy veg/fruit from Lidl you 100% would have to use it the same day you buy it, where as ALDI it lasts for a few days, so yes ALDI all day long 👍👍",Aldi
20,"Best shop, low price for good stuff 👍polit staff. …",Aldi
21,This Aldi is rather small when compared to other Aldis but still offers cheap prices. The lines are rather small compared to Lidl down the street.,Aldi
22,"This porridge is the best I have ever tasted, I been eating porridge since 1971.",Aldi
23,"Jammy dodgers here are absolutely banging, only 75 cents!!! No joke. Lovely atmosphere as well. Great bangers in the background. Go here if you want some good munch.",Aldi
24,"Crowded all the time, not many deals and not many selections. What's in the magazine u might get half of the dealz. Small and not easy to understand the placement of the items even if u will go there weekly. Staff are nice and helpful.
But there are no reinforced measures to some clients during this period.",Aldi
25,It's a great supermarket with lots of fresh produce and everything else but at very low prices. It's my go to place while I'm here in Dublin.,Aldi
26,"Have been shopping here for almost 10 years now.  Most of the time it's a good experience.  The reason why I am dropping a star is because there about 3 female staff members that are rather cold and rude towards me when they are on till but I also notice they are nicer other customers.  Have been contemplating making a complaint but the rudeness is so subtle that it's hard to verbalize.

I find myself having to check who are the cashiers as I enter the store and if those specific people are on the till, I turn around and go to the other supermarkets because it is not worth the toxicity.",Aldi
27,"Best supermarket around: price conveniently low, and quality/variety of products high. Tesco claim same price, but not same quality as far as I saw. I'm not fond of bla bla bio/fresh places. I know Aldi from Switzerland: again, good.
Just a bit far for me, but that's my fault :)",Aldi
28,"Today I suffered a very unpleasant and unfair situation in this shop and I was helpless and without help from the workers.

What happened is that I was carrying a Penney's bag and a woman tried to grab it while I was putting my purchase on the checkout conveyor belt.

I just grabbed my bag when I realised this and went to the till to pay and put my things away, the woman came and started to berate me that the bag was hers, to which I corrected her and told her no, the bag was mine, she started to get snippy and tell me to show her what was inside, As I didn't want any trouble, I showed it to her, then she started to say that she had the receipt, I also showed it to her and she started to tell me that I had to prove that the receipt was mine, which I found intolerable as I didn't have to give any explanation to this woman.

I asked the cashier to call security up to 4 times and he did absolutely nothing about it, he didn’t call security, which was his obligation as a woman was harassing one of his customers, that is, me. Finally I left the shop and after 10 minutes I went back to make a complaint, a manager came out, I explained what happened and they confirmed that they had looked at the security cameras and they could see how I entered with my bag, I told her that I wanted to make a complaint because their obligation was to call security and more when a customer asks for it up to 4 times, they told me that I was right, that they apologised, but nobody let me make my complaint, in other words, they ignored me.

That is why I have been obliged to put this review here so that people know that if they suffer any unfair act in this shop they will be totally helpless and unprotected. It's a shame that they make us customers feel this way, I go every week to spend my money at Aldi, and I just hope they learn about this and that it doesn't happen again to anyone.",Aldi
29,I'm giving 4 stars because the staff are fantastic. Really friendly and very efficient crew in a busy and chaotic setting. Be vigilant on the street outside as it can be full of interesting characters,Aldi
30,decent prices for groceries,Aldi
31,The Dried chestnuts 🌰 is super tasty …,Aldi
32,Would recommend it's a good quick aldi to be in and out of staff are quick also,Aldi
33,"The security guy here really knows his job,  I seen him catching a shoplifter yesterday 8/5/23 around 12 pm , i was nearby when it happened and the way he did it was so professional.",Aldi
34,Cheap and cheerful. Love their salads and they have a pretty good range of low fat and sugar free goods. They need to give a bigger selection of skin care and make up in the the Parnell Street branch.,Aldi
35,Due to the small size they never seem to get larger Special Buys. It is worth searching for a worker person as they do keep stock in the back that you wouldn't realise they have.,Aldi
36,"Super!
I just love Aldi!
Wide range of everything what we need at home.
Good foods/meals... Super nice sweets... fresh vegetables, fruits... cold drinks... lots of ideas, meats, seasonings for cooking... cheap prices... helpful staff!
You must try and definetely come back!!!
Unfortunately we do not have Aldi around my home but we really need one 💕💖❤️💞",Aldi
37,"Giving one star less because can never find my favourite full fat greek yogurt anymore.

Rest all I find every item on my grocery checklist and love their crispy shredded chicken. Amazing munchie 👌",Aldi
38,"Good place, nice location. Best prices and variety of goods. Should be recommended to everyone.",Aldi
39,"They don’t have wide range of products like other chain supermarkets. In fact the shelves were almost empty, vegetables and fruits weren’t fresh. The floor was dirty. I gave them 3 stars because of the guy who was at the till, he gave me the best customer service and I’ll those 3 stars are his but the shop I’ll rate negative 0  👎

Their prices are way too high compared to other chain supermarkets",Aldi
40,"One star! Beacuse you are offering 25 - 30 hours shift only.. Thats a joke.. I work 45 as a manager  in another store.. Friend told me that Aldi is okay that I should join you there.. But I m not working less than 40 hours.. I m not school kid, I need to provide roof and food for family.. 25 hours, JOKE!",Aldi
41,"Good enough, had most things I needed. Not the cheapest, but then again: it's Dublin.",Aldi
42,Seems like a decent store but the high proportion of oddly aggressive clientele made me feel like I had stepped into the overlook hotel.,Aldi
43,The prices on the shelves are one and when it arrives at the cashier to pay it is another.  I took two products that said it was a promotion at 2.90 salmon in the box 6.49 and a bottle of champagne on the shelf 10.49 but ended up paying 19.66 they should pay more attention to the prices of the goods offered for sale,Aldi
44,Really like this store it's close and in heart of city and love mum you boughet of roses for Valentines day 3.99yoyo 12 beautiful colours and grwat customer service staff ever so helpful and friendly 😇 …,Aldi
45,"Love the store! Amazing prices! Lot of promotions. I always go there!!
Always very clean and with helpful staff",Aldi
46,Staff need to relax  here I asked girl on till to wait till I moved out of her way before scanning next person's shopping and she just continued scanning this is very rude and no respect for customer or no customer care,Aldi
47,"Prices here is really good, it is small and in city centre, so some goods might run out quickly. I really like the cheese here, they are the cheapest, taste and  suitable for vegetarians.
What is really good here, most of the food here stated as suitable for vegetarians.",Aldi
48,"The least busy supermarket on parnell Street. The stock is usually pretty good contrasting with the lidl and Tesco suffering from empty shelves.
Would love to see a bakery with fresh bread and other options at some point 👏 …",Aldi
49,"I really like Aldi! Comparing to the other major markets, it's my first option nowadays: it's well organized, the prices, the quality and the variety of products are good, and the staff of this store is nice too.",Aldi
50,"This is my least favourite Aldi store. Its not well arranged so you are wandering from one isle to another trying to locate stuff & it's quite untidy. Very few cashiers so the lines are long. The cashier who took care of me was very professional, polite & efficient. It was quite apparent he was unwell. I don't think sick employees should be handling my food.",Aldi
51,Not good.  It's a clumsy one.,Aldi
52,The best place to do groceries. It's my favourite!!!! I wish they have an app. And if they have one I didn't know it. But I would definitely be interested in having it,Aldi
53,The cheapest supermarket in Dublin. Vegetable and fruits from there are really good and very cheap. I do my weekly shopping there I just don’t like the  chicken breast from there. Overall very satisfied,Aldi
54,Beautiful shop everything you need under one roof and the staff are extremely friendly and the staff are very quick and very efficient,Aldi
55,"Excellent small aldi. Staff are excellent, super helpful and nice.

The special buys section is small so you know, middle aisle experience isn't the same as it is at the bigger ones but you still find a few gems.",Aldi
56,It's okay. Shop much smaller than similar stores. Only one till operating. Still...I got what I needed at the time.,Aldi
57,As usual . Good affordable food and cheap alcohol free beer! Thank you Aldi,Aldi
58,Its a big Aldi's with a lot of there own brands and big brands. Monday to Friday it's opened from 9 o'clock in the morning till 10 o'clock at night. Weekend is 9 o'clock in the morning till 9 o'clock at night,Aldi
59,"Yeah it's ok, the problem I have with Aldi and lidl's is most of the things are imported from England and so, yet there adds say we back 100-percent Irish, not true.",Aldi
60,City centre outlet. Difficult to find parking and only a small selection of the non food special offers. Always busy. Fine for food shopping and despite being a small unit shelves seem to be restocked efficiently.,Aldi
61,I like this store because  people and staff are so nice  no rush camping in side do ure shopping and you can think about be for u buy stuff  clean and not stuffy I enjoy shopping their 🌍😷 …,Aldi
62,"Very good value for groceries, and their Special Buys programme has seasonal items (including furniture and clothes) for reasonable prices too. The queues are managed well and the produce is usually very good quality.",Aldi
63,I went there at 21:55 today. Shop was closed. Security came to the door and asked me not to enter. They were supposed to be open until 10 pm.,Aldi
64,"My visit was great apart from a rude and unhelpful security guard (white)
I asked for help with a trolley and he didnt/wouldn't help me, unlike the security officer(black) from the week before who was extremely helpful and went out of his way to do so.",Aldi
65,Great food shop in Dublin. You can find also some snacks. Prices are great.,Aldi
66,"It's Aldi, they don't vary much from one another.
Was disappointed about the size of the special offers isle in the Parnell Street Store. I walked around and was convinced it was gone. One side of a short isle, big whoop!
I'm more of a special offers shopper than the Grocery side of the store.
Food wise it is a nice store.",Aldi
67,"Can't say where this Aldi in particular is heading to. Customers and staff are quiet outputting.
I still love the place. Hope the staff gets better right soon they are what makes the store work.",Aldi
68,"Well-run medium-sized Aldi with a bakery inside.  Good selection and good prices.  Staff is very friendly and helpful, especially the Polish store manager",Aldi
69,"Just had an awfull experience in Aldi (parnell street). While waiting inside the store along with other customers as it was raining, im realized i left my wallet with my partner who was in another store  and said to the following customers that they could go inside first as i was waiting for someone. Talked with the security and he said i could wait for the person on a corner inside the store. When my partner arrived ( not sure if it was because it was another guy) the security ""changed his mind"" and told him to go to the end of the queue. When asked why he had to go to the end of the queue when i already had explained the situation and he had previously agreed, he started shouting at me, like if i was a criminal or something. Then asked another security to speak with the manager about the issue, as the previous one was still shouting alone in the entrance. When talking to the management, although they apologised and were very friendly, i was told that the security was from another company and wasnt an Aldi employee, so i had the feeling nobody would speak with him and nothing would be done.  While i could understand i would have to go inside the store alone if told that previously, its really not okay to shout out at a customer, specially if he is not demonstrating a bad behaviour. Wont be shopping in Aldi again and dont recomend anyone to go there if its to be treated like that.",Aldi
70,"Been going to this Aldi for almost 3 years. Staff are great, and a few have been there for as long as I remember. Not the biggest so it lacks a little compared to suburban locations but it's got everything I need. Almost always very busy.",Aldi
71,"Really love this store. Normally a bigger fan of Lidl, although there is something about this store. Its more like a Supervalu. Lovely staff. Terrible bedding plants. They always die :) - great well layout shop",Aldi
72,"Aldi, Parnell St, us a great store,
Always clean and ever willing staff to assist you in your needs.
Unfailingly friendly at cash desks, it's a pleasure to shop there.
Just one thing, stock up on more Bloomers brown bread. It sells out fast.",Aldi
73,"The staff are very friendly, very excellent customer service, I recommended buy everything from Aldi very good environment",Aldi
74,Best deals in town. New exciting food products introduced all the time. Fun middle aisle too. Very affordable,Aldi
75,Reasonable priced pleasant staff,Aldi
76,"City centre Aldi, massively busy but fairly fast Q's at the checkouts. It's quite small so doesn't have the full Aldi range. What it does have is good.",Aldi
77,Great prices! Have lots of yummy foods. I would suggest if they could add more cashiers or maybe add self check out machine. Would save more time :),Aldi
78,"There was a lady in front of me in the queue. I said you haven't bought anything. She was keeping a place for her daughter and children who arrived after, and jumped into the queue. When I was packing my shopping. I was subjected to extreme expletives by the daughter. I couldn't believe it. Did I do something wrong? This is customary in Aldi, people jump the queue all the time. Security don't even notice.",Aldi
79,We have too many options to choose from while it's even the cheapest place to do your daily shopping from compared to the rest. The staff is also very helpful.,Aldi
80,"Lovely place!! really appreciated the security man, he said that I could carry my scooter stand up instead of  carrying it betweens my arms.",Aldi
81,Excellent hygiene measures in place for covid-19... extremely friendly and helpful staff😀👍👍👍 and incredible value for money what more can I say😀👍👌👌👌 …,Aldi
82,I Love the variety of items for such a great price. The saving you can make on your weekly shop is really Amazing!!!!!,Aldi
83,Everything sells out quickly in this store because it's in town so get in early,Aldi
84,Everthing is very good if you don't have much money at least you can eat,Aldi
85,"This supermarket is located central for the islac shopping centre near Moore Street the Dominic Street luas stop it sells Groceries, Flowers and other item's it has a excellent off licence very well stocked well worth a visit",Aldi
86,"As we all know, we have different shopping outlets for various purposes. One of our main point of retail shopping is Lidl. They provide every essential things in cheap price. And  I like the way they treat the customer.",Aldi
87,"Doesn't follow the 'typical' Aldi layout, but nonetheless reliable. Different product categories are shoehorned into position, no self service despite most shoppers only buying a small number of items. Very friendly staff. Disconcerting number of security guards.",Aldi
88,"I have no idea why Aldi is paying a secrurity guard to check that people keep distance and get only in after others leaving the market, when they let some people in while others waiting! A dog could do better Job! Shame on you! Disgraceful!",Aldi
89,"The security left in ppl without mask and in general ppl do not respect the distance, plus respect to others Aldi this one doesn't have the same choices and variety. I'm not going anymore!",Aldi
90,"Decent prices in an expensive city. Not easy to buy food on the cheap in Dublin, especially city centre",Aldi
91,"Great prices for decent quality products, not a one-stop weely shop location but definitely the place to go for the basics.",Aldi
92,"It's less crowded and more organized than lidl and tesco. Somethings like olive oil, salt, pepper were cheaper also. Recommended. Lines for the cashier is the only downside.",Aldi
93,"Fresh Products and reasonably priced. Great space around the store. I have found a few favourites which I now purchase regularly, in Aldi Blanchardstown.",Aldi
94,Great value love the bloomer bread half the price that local shops,Aldi
95,You have to queue to long to pay for your shopping only 2 tills opened and 6 or 8 closed ridiculous,Aldi
96,If you can't find something in the store I'd like to be shown exactly where something is and not told because that makes all the difference on whether or not you provide good service. I'm hoping I won't have the same experience then next time I visit...,Aldi
97,"Great meat/steak with good prices, I also love the Muzzarella cheese from Aldi and for the other itens the price are very good.",Aldi
98,If im rush prefer over other stores in city center due to never packed and low waiting time on tills.,Aldi
99,Is a good option because it's more expensive than lidl (just a bit) but is cheaper than tesco. Also it has some things with really interesting prices. I recommend it.,Aldi
100,"Hadn't been to this Aldi for a while now and I must say I was a little disappointed. There was nobody at the door monitoring entrants. No sanatizing of trollies or baskets going on.
Generally just disappointing",Aldi

117,It's good to know from their weekly mag.what to  shop so not to be disappointed with empty shelves when there racking down & good sell or use by dates?,Aldi
118,"All I can say is compared to the United States, the Aldi’s in Ireland and the UK are a step or two above. They have a larger array of prepared fresh and frozen foods, some with local delicious Irish foods and some Asian food. One Irish woman said “mine is better” in comparison to pregoared fresh roast beef with mashed parsnip potatoes. It was delicious, saving me £/$.  The Aldi locations in the USA must be a huge disappointment to those visiting the US. They have some equipped with a small bakery, larger building way affordable. Please upgrade all Aldi’s in the USA.☺️😇🙏🏽",Aldi

522,This kiosk is on one of the streets in Ireland offering Nigerian food. The friendly and cheerful attentive staff. They are only Fridays and Saturdays. There are tables on the street where you can eat it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The somewhat spicy rice and the rich beef,Aldi
523,"There were no queues (5 pm)
The windows are full
Normal market",Aldi
524,Normal supermarket just outside Dublin city center with significantly cheaper prices than in the center.,Aldi
525,"Great in every way, very well organized environment, variety of products and great quality combined with good prices. I bought a package of frozen peas and I didn't even see that the packaging was torn, the box noticed, showed it to me and even though we didn't speak the same language she helped me, she was very kind and helpful and exchanged the product for me. Congratulations to the entire Aldi team.",Aldi
526,"Despite its size it is good, the prices are low, you can find a bit of everything.",Aldi
527,"Surely, along with Lidl, the cheapest supermarket in Ireland.
Good quality sausages and meats, better than in other supermarkets.
I do not recommend buying milk here, it usually goes bad days before its expiration date and once opened it lasts only 24/36 hours.",Aldi
528,"Supermarket with cheap prices. The supermarket can be useful for buying basic necessities but I have many doubts about the quality of the products themselves. Supermarket with a lot of assortment and located in a convenient place in the city, very central. It is in the style of Lidl, that is, it is also possible to find household products, games and so on depending on the weekly offers.",Aldi
529,"It is interesting, it has many things
It's great
Very kind people help you where you can get things you can't find

532,"Aldi Süd, almost like in Germany only in small format. The range is slightly different. The employees I encountered were all friendly",Aldi
533,Very Good Chain Store,Aldi
534,"At this location the employees are not careful when giving change. I work hard for pennies. It is not a problem for 4 euros, but in this period of crisis it matters. Otherwise I am satisfied.",Aldi
535,Clean and usually not many people. The range is sufficient but not the widest,Aldi
536,"ALDI in the city center has too many people and few things, making it uncomfortable to walk around.",Aldi

1,Was not happy I got a pippa pig for my child but when I opened it was a paw petrol dont drive and would mean a bus back up to try get a pippa pig on not happy this is false advertisement,Aldi
2,"Used to be my favourite supermarket, raved to everyone about it. Unfortunately it's got very poor in the last few months. So, so many out of date products or about to be you have to be very careful. I almost bought sausage rolls 5 days out of date!!!",Aldi
3,Save a shed load money by avoiding Supervalue and the likes and do the monthly shop here.,Aldi
4,Nice to buy lots : special food,Aldi
5,Nice little aldi. Nothing big. Good aprking. Next to other competitors. Free parking. Family car slots available right next to door for people with children. Great.,Aldi

11,Aldi is a great supermarket for value shopping!   You can find amazing prices especially for veggies and fruits. Highly recommended!,Aldi
12,Lovely aldi all ur grocery needs in one shop,Aldi
13,"Great local shop with most of things you need in the house, easy to find what you are looking for, try not to get lost in the middle isles.",Aldi
14,Only moving things around and not a lot of space to stroll through the aisles.,Aldi
15,Sunday was an absolute joke by management and security waited two hours to be informed that the airfryers were sold Saturday clearly to friends of staff. All other stores had a plan in place not to leave customers outside all morning for nothing. We were also told they would contact us individually on the matter no contact either from anyone,Aldi
16,"Good store, different selection, great price.",Aldi
17,"Great place to shop at reasonable price, but not so lively. Take time relax find out the price variation and buy. But customer service is poor as they are outnumbered of staffs.",Aldi
18,"Love it. Competitive prices, good choice of products, quiet and friendly place.",Aldi
19,One of my go to stores. Can get a little busy - especially when there's special offers from the brochures. Usually find what I was looking for. They are quick to open up extra checkouts when queues get too big. Unfortunately lack EV charging facilities in carpark,Aldi
20,It provides for all types of people and had a bakery fresh brown baps rolls and white bread and caters 4 all most  every  thing you would want to eat 😋  resable price ide give it a 4 star review …,Aldi
21,"Very good shop, I was there 9.30pm, and still get everything I looking for.",Aldi
22,"It’s always a bit of hassle to get a parking space, but must be because locals park their cars there. Inside the store is most of the times not too busy. Needs a bit of a good deep cleaning, baskets are dirty (if you find one available at the entrance), floor needs a massive deep cleaning. Other than that All good and staff are ok too.",Aldi
23,Good Price Good selection.,Aldi
24,"Best supermarket,i havent shopped my food shop anywhere else in about 6 years and its awkward as i dont drive so i need to get taxis.
But worth it as i get everything under the 1 roof. Including lunches dinners dog food cleaning supplys softner vitamins toiletries snacks ect.
The special buys are also great!",Aldi
25,"As with all Aldi's, good value and good quality. Very clean also. Friendly staff.",Aldi
26,"We shopped there Sunday  only had 4 items and had to wait half hour before items been chequed at the till. due to people with full trolley ahead of us. great says you,  you need to sort a cheque out for people with less that 10 items.  I will be shopping Monday in future. Very relaxing.",Aldi
27,"VERY helpful security guy on today. Sunday 15th Aug @ about 19:00. If his manager sees this he should mention that one of his customers singled him out for special mention. In fact come to think of it, I have been there several times and the security were helpful. So maybe that should be mentioned to them. It is noticed and appreciated!",Aldi
28,I bought the entire store for like 27 cents. Kidding aside I did buy some crackers that costed 24 cents and they were good. That's pretty awesome!,Aldi
29,"Facility Too small, plus on my visit I seen 1 staff member, try catch 3 people out. All 3 ahead of me paid by cash & were all short changed, all questioned it & got their money back (hardly any apology). I decided to pay by card so the same didn't happen to me, but he purposely scanned same product twice!, right in front  of me! I  immediately addressed it and he sorted it no apology. Big concern about that. Will be extra careful, if, I go back there!",Aldi
30,"Aldi Coolock, was checked out by a young man on Aisle 2 he was so pleasant and polite as well as being very helpful.  ALDI should be very proud of him.",Aldi
31,"I have always preferred Aldi to Lidl. This Aldi is a Great big shop. It has brilliant middle aisle deals. The food is great. Prices have gone up as we noticed. Has a bigger, better range in this shop.",Aldi
32,Great place to get a little or a lot cheap on pocket not all in-store brands also other brands too. Always good value middle isles only negative is the car parking space but that's out of their control.,Aldi
33,"Wish staff wouldn't keep pushing loading trolleys under customers feet. They make customers feel like they are in the way. I understand it's cheap and cheerful and this is part of it, but difficult to shop in their stores for staff running around with big re packing for shelves.",Aldi
34,Great store bright and fresh. Staff are fantastic,Aldi
35,Great value. Good parking very busy at weekends. Good selection of wine at reasonable prices. Stock management can be poor at times and store often runs out of regular stock,Aldi
36,Very friendly and cooperative staff. Excellent layout and spacious isles. Never have to wait long in the que as they open the other tills if they see more than 3 or 4 people in line waiting at opened tills. Always a pleasure to shop here.,Aldi
37,Was there just today and the Covid protocols are a disgrace. I have given 2 stars as the staff are nice but I really didn't want to hang around as the lack of mask wearing and social distancing in this shop is scary. Security don't seem to have an issue with it either.,Aldi
38,"Well stocked , fast queues and great prices",Aldi
39,"Great place to shop. The variety and quality of produce continually improves while at the same time remaining incredibly good value for money. The one downfall is the staff  who can be very surly and unhelpful when appriached for assistance.  I should add that it is only some of the staff but enough too many for my liking.  The should never be too busy ordisinterested, to assist customers  but unfortunately in my experience some of them are and they can be quite rude about it.",Aldi
40,Its great to dispose of rubbish correctly. And thanks to the lady on the phone today who looked for my silver bracelet i thought I lost there. But it was found outside my local chemist!!,Aldi
41,"Typical Aldi, usually busy but always open extra tills in response to level of shoppers. Carlos new sourdough pizza is the best home cooked pizza I have had and at 2.99 it's a steel as beats some of the pizza shops in local area👌 …",Aldi
42,Great value. Very efficient and friendly staff the one thing that needs to  be addressed is the disabled parking spots. I am registered disabled person and nine times out of 10 the 2 spots are taked by able bodied people or those with an out of date permits.,Aldi
43,Plenty of parking and quiet,Aldi
44,"Good range of products and they're excellent value.  Plus I like that they are always introducing new products.  Nicely laid out too, so it's easy to find what you want.",Aldi
45,Renovated aldi with more space and great prices as usual.,Aldi
46,Good store to shop in well laid out clean and good value fir money. Only negative is the constant opening and closing of check out lanes. Its enough to make hou walk out without purchased on the busier days,Aldi
47,My local supermarket.  Always well stocked with fresh fruit and veg along with quality Irish meat and dairy produce.  Courteous and friendly staff.  The weekly specials are always a highlight with high quality items at a fraction of the cost of big brand names.,Aldi
48,"Staff are super,always on top of the amount of people needed on the tills so the ques moves very well.    Have a great variety if everything in there that is needed. In my opinion, the best supermarket around . Much better than dunnes and supervalue on price and then  best of all their meats last better and produce lasts better than lidl. Really enjoy shopping there.  Staff are so polite.",Aldi
49,I hadn't been in a long time but was pleasantly surprised. Fruit and vegetables great plus lovely candles. There is something there that will take everyone's fancy.,Aldi
50,Lads sort it out get self service queue queuing up the get a breakfast smoothie while Norris and clarence are doing a full 8 months shop is Major. And of course norris can't be sound and say you go ahead you're only getting 1 thing,Aldi
51,"Easy to go shop for most of your needs, easy to park and easy to shop in",Aldi
52,Still good but prices are creeping up😩😩Dunnes is cheaper now I think …,Aldi
53,"Atrocious parking during peak hours and expect to queue at the till...but no other grocer offers the value for money they do. When tesco match their prices they reduce their quality.  Look out for their super 6 each week in special offer fruit and veg. To keep their prices down they often change suppliers and can sometimes therefore not have certain products in store sometimes for weeks on end, which is irritating, but you do save a considerable amount on your weekly shop.",Aldi
54,"I love Aldi in Coolock and I always shop here. . It has lovely staff on checkouts. They are always helpful and friendly. . However, I was extremely disappointed yesterday evening  that there were 3 young females in store without masks and no one apprehended them. I felt uncomfortable and it wouldn't encourage me to return to this store while the virus is so active in community.",Aldi
55,"Well stocked, can be slow at check outs",Aldi
56,I arrived at Aldi at 7.48pm on good friday 10th of april to be told by the security man that we are closed and it read on their website that the store closes at 8pm so i had a wasted journey but what annoyed me most was the attitude of the security man  as he was very dismissive towards me and i have never had a problem problem before this ever so rude.,Aldi
57,"A brilliant Aldi, probably the best one I've ever been in, very friendly and efficient staff, shelves and fridges fully stocked and excellent variety to boot!",Aldi
58,"I've been a reguar shopper here over the past year but I'm not going back.
Selection is down but:
The main reason being the number of anti maskers and covid-19 deniers shopping here unchallenged.
Pavel is not able to challenge them and won't deny service. It's a pity.",Aldi
59,Good choice of food and middle aisle stuff,Aldi
60,great supermarket with good value.  Good range of useful home products and some fantastic bargains.  as a coeliac there is a wide range of suitable produce at competitive prices.  excellent service,Aldi
61,"One of my favorite places to shop, Aldi have a great variety of products and cater for nearly all budgets and tastes. Every couple of weeks they have special offers on fruit and vegetables and also on meats. There is a good variety of wines in the off license dept and some weekly deals on hardware products!!",Aldi
62,Aldi  is Not a good place to shop   they up the price of pet foods making it harder for everyone....prices  of everything  increasing .....i think we entering  a recession unfortunately.....we are all working  for Peanuts  Now....,Aldi
63,Nice new layout in the store. Wide aisles so ideal for wheelchairs. Well stocked and good value. Some bargains hidden among the shelves 👍 …,Aldi
64,It's annoying that there is no basket checkouts and have to stand in long lines for just a few items. Also annoying that the staff are on and off their tills every few minutes to stock shelves. Why dont they employ floor staff ?,Aldi
65,I shop here weekly. Love the selection but they could treat their staff better. Every time I'm there I see something questionable. Which is a shame cos a lot of the staff are lovely.,Aldi
66,"Really place if you want to save money. Can always find fresh fruits and vegs with a nice price. Everything clean and organized, and loads of options for garden (plants, furniture, vases, compost).",Aldi
67,Just ok. A bit dearer than lidl. It's OK if you are stuck for something .,Aldi
68,Great staff great shop always well stocked lots to choose from regarding household and garden furniture and accessories as well as some building supplies,Aldi
69,"So many great value and quality items that I can't get in Northern Ireland.
Come on Aldi, open some branches that are easier to reach!",Aldi
70,"I usually like this branch of Aldi (Coolock) but today it was very low on stock, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables. Great prices on what I did manage to get but I'll have to do another shop elsewhere for the items they didn't have.",Aldi
71,It was Fantastic value and the staff are very helpful and friendly. It's a pity the East wall store doesn't take a few lessons from them,Aldi
72,Like shopping here only thing I dont like is date of foods on shelves are not checked enough have picked up food that was  expiring on that day or day after . Staff is lovely in this store .,Aldi
73,"Great shop,gets quite busy at times but it's nice and big and great value for money.",Aldi
74,The chap on the checkout couldn't have been more helpful to me,Aldi
75,"Definitely the best in Dublin, it is really organised, it is big and not as crowded as others. This supermarket brand offers great products at a lower price, you could make 3 times your groceries shopping compared to 1 in Tesco (to say the most popular ones). The attention is very good as well.",Aldi
76,Good variety of goods... nice prices... not the most friendly staff I saw,Aldi
77,Considering how busy the shops are this was grand. Staff filling the shelves as quick as they can. Great shop,Aldi
78,"There is a lot talk, about Aldington being cheaper than other Supermarkets, I don't find it to be true.
A good range of gluten free, I shop around. Stafford efficient, store laid, Clean,",Aldi
79,"Happy wife happy life
Great fresh produce
Great pricepoints
Friendly staff💚☘🇮🇪
Would love to work for this company
Ive tried so many times to no avail🌻",Aldi
80,"Perfect for getting the things you forgot in a hurry, plenty of fresh vegetables. Got plenty of Easter bargains to use next year.",Aldi
81,Ask a staff memberfor assistance ... he could have been botthered clearly as he was talking with his colleague about going drinking. Plus the store was clearly a mess from people grabbing for the newstock but christ cant just expect people to climb over the mess,Aldi
82,"This place is NIRVANA! so much of everything! And the unnecessary ""plastic"" objects are essential- they have wool, patterns,  food, the lot and that lemon,ginger,cardamom that grandma loves!",Aldi
83,Love shopping in Aldi got a slow cooker today and can't wait to get cooking. Thank u,Aldi
84,"Great for a quick shop - you know where everything is! Great value fruit n veg, more organic stuff than before, second only to Supervalu now..",Aldi
85,Grt  got  some  good  bargains   onions  tamatoes   i was  looking   for  eye  cream  4  for  a few  months  now  no joy  yet  the  serum  is  amazing   i love  it  please  get  it  soon ❤,Aldi
86,What can I say about Aldi? Who doesn't like shopping there? It's great. Great range of products and moving with the times. Coolock Aldi is lovely and really big. The only downside to Aldi is the constant discontinuing of products. They may reappear but often don't. No explanation. Great value shopping overall.,Aldi
87,"Not a bad shop, good range and no long queues as the open all check-outs...staff are nice too.",Aldi
88,"The store itself was just like any other, but the carpark tends to be be a bit tight and very busy.",Aldi
89,Not the best Aldi I've been to but has a reasonable selection. Very cramped layout and can be very busy.,Aldi
90,"Staff are lovely, friendly and so helpful, food is fresh and devine, prices and there are no queues even if there are it's very quick, always great experience, thanks Aldi 😀 …",Aldi
91,Staff are always lovely and friendly. I like doing my weekly shop here. Always a bargain on offer.,Aldi
92,The prices cannot be beaten . Fresh fruit vegetables meats so good. And staff friendly and efficient,Aldi
93,Could do with a revamp and some new lines in stock,Aldi
94,The shop is clean and there is a great deal of variety of goods to choose from.  The checkout staff are so polite.,Aldi
95,"Great shopping friendly staff great service. Same friendly service as always.
Service is as good as ever.",Aldi
96,"Since you changed the design of your premises it is no pleasure shopping there. Whoever planned the floor layout needs go back and start again. A new design I can understand, but racks of flowers and stock all over the shop floor is definitely off putting. I have shopped with Aldi Coolock for many years but I think after today Lidi may be a better option.
Yours Regrettably
Charles Galvin",Aldi
97,"Great for doing the weekly shop, or for to just grab those few bit's to get through a couple of day's. Great product at a great price.",Aldi
98,Great sop's and staff,Aldi
99,Love Aldi (except it's always freezing ..wear a coat ). The value for money is exceptional and stocks a great range too. My daughter is a coeliac and I get a lot of her basics here.,Aldi
100,"My fav grocery store. I prefer coolock, however the layout is similar in all aldis which is good. I love their special buys. I find them great value for money. In all Aldi is exc value for money",Aldi
101,"Competitive value and great selection. I do wish they would drop the ""specially packed for"" as this does not show actual origin of products and is therefore irrelevant.",Aldi
102,"Great place for shopping, ample parking spaces and good staff.",Aldi
103,Great shop everything that you need in one place. Very fast checkouts with lovely staff.,Aldi
104,Not bad should have more tills open as shops always packed a lot of waiting while lots of staff are walking around de shop.,Aldi
105,"Yea good to shop here tings are not too exspencive wit a wide variety of tiñg from clothes to tool etc..,.,,..",Aldi
106,"Brilliant shop friendly staff, really helpful.",Aldi
107,"Supermarket shopping,hardly a life changing experience ,but necessary all the same.Aldi Coolock store ,my nearest one , pleasant staff ,centre aisle and special buys are good value .Shopped recently on a Monday afternoon ,found the store less crowded.Ample car parking.",Aldi
108,Great priced and excellent quality with a good selection of Irish meats . Only downside I found is not enough tills open when I was there,Aldi
109,Very busy store. Products could be better organized.,Aldi
110,Very good shop where you can get all the weekly groceries at excellent price. The special buys could be better as competitors have better ones,Aldi
111,because they have everthing you need and a lot cheaper,Aldi
112,"Great value, as always, but very hard to get parking. Ideally,  don't shop there on a Saturday afternoon!",Aldi
113,"Great prices
Great deals on a wide variety of items
From a lawnmower to slow cooker
You can find anything throughout the year",Aldi
114,"Great store, plenty of parking, great produce, good prices. Staff helpful.",Aldi
115,"Same Aldi as everywhere else with good stock levels. The parking here can be awful though, so I'd recommend going at an off peak time.",Aldi
116,"Love the variety they have in here of convenience foods and health foods. Also, super comfy, spacious. Best Aldi I have seen till date.",Aldi
117,"Great selction food, household, clothes, health and beauty and special buys.
Checkouts managed well for demand and staff very helpful. True Aldi experience",Aldi
118,Good selection and great prices. Stock control could be better and having pallets in the aisles during opening hours is unacceptable.,Aldi

1,Hard to find low fat low salt low sugar readymade meals all are still to hi in every very little veg or spice or herbs that's what make a good testing meal not sugar fat & salt they are getting better but still have a long way to go veg meal are poor some needs to look on the net for veg meal to see what good one looks like,Aldi
2,"Huge store. Good parking. Needs to have Avonmore milk in their shelf. Good, they open on Easter bank holiday.",Aldi
3,"I like the long-awaited price competition with Aldi an Lidl.  Yesterday,  I shopped at Aldi for the first time in year's. I tried to buy the same products as I buy in Lidl - a little more in fact and I paid €5 less overall than in Lidl.  Small but significant.",Aldi
4,Went in to get a few things but came out with more. Great deals and friendly staff,Aldi
5,"Great store , great prices all the time , no vouchers needed",Aldi
6,One of the best supermarkets in the area. Usually quite clean and great value.,Aldi
7,"Oh Aldi, I will give you a tree because even though you are cheaper than most of the shops around you do not give €10 or €50 voucher codes or anything like that so you could do better",Aldi
8,"The Aldi in Santry is brilliant, always well stocked and loads of variety..",Aldi
9,"I have been shopping in this Aldi more than 2 years and I am happy with cashiers and personnel all the time.  It is my number 1 store after Tesco around here.
By saying this, today I am very disappointed by the treatment of a cashier that I have not seen before there.  The blonde lady with glasses seems to me picking people to warn about very unknown rule - you would be normally warned by ""next time you come into the store bring a trolley to load your groceries into "" in this time I am warned in opposite way -  no trolleys can be used to load and unload your bag, therefore you need to pack in and make wait others wait for you  which is totally opposite of other stores doing.
Furthermore, there were trolleys after the checkpoint which is actually a sign of she is picking people to warn. It makes me feel being discriminated based on my ethnicity.",Aldi
10,This is a great Aldi. Always well stocked. Staff are helpful and friendly.,Aldi
11,"It's a pretty nice Aldi. Reasonably organized and clean (aka doesn't feel claustrophobic like some other Aldis) and the staff are extremely helpful. They also have a wide variety of products, even if they don't have many units of each item",Aldi
12,Spacious to shop in and a fairly big store..,Aldi
13,Lady at the cash counter was very helpful.,Aldi
14,"Good standard Aldi, low prices on good quality food and goods.  Food items can be relativity sophisticated at very reasonable prices.  Range a bit limited in comparison with some more expensive supermarkets but not seriously so.",Aldi
15,Wide variety of products available and very good choice and price.    One thing that could be addressed is the supermarket trolleys not being returned to the trolley bays by customers.   I saw a number of people just leaving them in the car park and could cause an obstruction or damage to vehicles.   Perhaps this could be monitored periodically to ensure trolleys are rounded up and returned to the correct area by member of staff.,Aldi
16,Regular grocery store with great selections,Aldi
17,Great value for money. The best supermarket for quality and price for your weekly shop. Can't beat it.,Aldi
18,Good place to shop,Aldi
19,"Great store for grocery, household and gardening products, nicely laid out, plenty of free parking",Aldi
20,"Enjoy visiting this shop for house goods shopping great selection of foods and treats, not forgetting the middle island bargains",Aldi
21,Good selection of food products especially cold meats.  Flowers are great value and a great range too. Good for a gander for the weekly special offers. Good parking and queues managed well at tills.,Aldi
22,"Great staff friendly so helpful.Stock great price so easy must buy.Bread to die for stock is that
Good.Granary bread Hovis luv it.Layout very very good easy shopping.When shop packed staff
Just handle it with ease they don't panic just so friendly.",Aldi
23,"Great shop, click and collect is great, very smooth system and an easy to use platform. It would be great if when searching for ""usuals"" that these items would all show up in one page, other than that great to just reorder shopping list. Well done",Aldi
24,"Excellent. I had the brochure & got all I wanted on ""special"". Plants were dead. Cashier very pleasant. Got wine I didn't get in Coolock. 7.30pm. a great time to shop for a 69yr. old. I will be 70 next week but I never get up before 12noon.",Aldi
25,Delighted to see they have upgraded their Santry shop which is now much more modern and very clean,Aldi
26,"Clean and well lit but they only had one working toll st closing time resulting in a mad rush trying to get any alcohol purchases in before 10 pm, and there were no trolleus next to the doors",Aldi
27,Always fresh fruits and vegetables,Aldi
28,This is my favourite local shopping centre and has plenty of parking in its facilities. It is a very economic shop so easy on the wallet. But even though I'm a fan it is limited by its selection compared to other main stream grocery shopping centres.,Aldi
29,It's a very good place,Aldi
30,Clean & well-stocked. Cheap clothing. Many alternative replicas of branded products that are mainly less appetising but OK. Generally good meat choice & reasonable quality.  Fresh fruit & veg has short life. Not great for quick smaller shopping trips as no self-scan or 10 item checkouts.,Aldi
31,"It was relatively good when we got there as it was a.Sunday. There was Security on the door keeping watch on the numbers going in but as there wasn't too many , everyone was well away from each other. Plenty on hand sanitisers as well as paper towels to use in conjunction with the sanitiser to wipe down trollies when needed.",Aldi
32,Lot's of varieties for every product. A lot of staff to handle rush plus has bicycle parking as well,Aldi
33,Was empty and easy to get around but I can see there prices going up so watch out,Aldi
34,"Santry store is nice , great pricing on items but my only suggestions would be to have more specials fortnightly, also some of the staff are not great at hello or smiling at you at the till especially the short cheeky foreign blond haired female.

Tough face but very unfriendly.  One guy in particular from the store is rude and totally ignores you and does not hand you back your money without as much as a thank you or acknowledgement. He is not nice at all so I avoid certain staff for that reason.

If the managers could chat to their supervisors on customer service skills for their staff and possibly retrain some of them to be more welcoming and less of the scouling faces from the females. That would be a change and greatly appreciated.",Aldi
35,Nice  place to go to shop ! Very low prices and a lot of things you need in your home every day! I shop in this store every week and I’m very impressed! Nice staff! Good job !,Aldi
36,"The Aldi store on Santey Lane has been there for many years and is very popular with the local people , they have weekly special offers and the food is good quality,the also sell toiletries and house hold goods these goods totaled on a seasonal basis.",Aldi
37,As a grocery store it's great. They also sell lots of other product..,Aldi
38,"Great value for money. Great stock levels  Food of very good quality. Never an issue with and fresh veg , fruit or meats. Quick in and out as always independent stores and no distractions to other stores like in the bigger shopping centres. Love Aldi..",Aldi
39,"As Peter stated, poor traffic management. There needs to be more action regarding poor parking, as it is in the middle of a busy road not designed for 1/4 of the current traffic. How they got planning permission is beyond me.
Still, the store itself is good,but tends to run out of stock if you're there in the evening time.",Aldi
40,Very good price and choices,Aldi
41,"If it was possible to give a minus rating I would, I'm sick and tired of buying food from this kip only to get home and find out that it's rancid despite having a valid date. Chicken, steaks, even cans of tuna can't be trusted. Smell everything when you open it.",Aldi
42,"This is frills free supermarket shopping at its best. Customer shopping experience might be jeopardised but quality, choice, and price of food is most definitely not. You will have to pack your own bags at the bagging area but you won't wait long at the till and the savings and quality are more than worth it.",Aldi
43,Good shopping experience,Aldi
44,"Once again I proved myself right. You can spend millions on upgrading your business, but at the end all depends from your staff. No wonder I dont shop here even though its 5 min from my house. Will try again in 10 years.
For now, thanks and see you later.",Aldi
45,My favourite place,Aldi
46,Nice shop,Aldi
47,Good store but fairly unfriendly staff. I understand the store is busy but the till staff are just eager to get you out and get rid of the queue. Also wish there were self service tills for smaller purchases.,Aldi
48,Good stuff.. sometimes very crowed.. helpful staff if you can find them.. mostly they are busy doing there work of refilling when many people cone to shop.. don't understand why can't they refill before or after the shop open for business.. big loading trolleys take space and most of the time kept in front of products a customer wants to buy.. and it doesn't even look safe as kids come and something can fall off the trolley makes the place very tight to move around..,Aldi
49,Usually great value but recently less products available and prices have gone up significantly,Aldi
50,"Excellent value, extremely helpful freindly staff all times, parking always available, very clean &hygenic,I do most of my shopping there ,always great bargains,their staff are so friendly and kind and helpful ,very spacious for prams wheelchair etc.",Aldi
51,Really clean and fully stocked. Great produce,Aldi
52,"Big shop. Lots of good nick necks
Friendly staff. Never packed. Homebreaĝ",Aldi
53,Nice big store... but you couldnt get down the aisles as pallets in middle of floor... restocking of shelves should be done before store opens or after it closes. Health safety issue if somebody gets hurt.,Aldi
54,"Aldi in Santry Lane has been updated,  with wider lanes and well stocked shelves. The meat section is particularly good, we'll worth checking out.",Aldi
55,"It's a place with genuinely priced items. I found chicken and meats bit cheaper than other stores. Although most of the eating stuffs were about to expire, it's yet a good store to shop groceries.",Aldi
56,"Great supermarket. I haven't been here in a while - Lidl and Supervalu are more convenient - but I was blown away by the quality and range on offer, for my shop today fresh beef and fish in particular. They're also selling a nice range of Christmas puddings, etc., and in the year of COVID it surely is OK to eat Christmas cake in October!!!!! Great value as always, no queue to get in (midday Thursday) and plenty of space to maintain social distancing (very effective traffic light system on the entrance).  Although relatively long queues had built up by my time to checkout (3+ at all open checkouts), staff responded very quickly and the queues were cleared within 5 minutes. Really impressive customer service!  Definitely time to return to regular shopping at Aldi Santry Avenue!",Aldi
57,"I like this place except my biggest and really my only complaint is that it's often packed with people and more often than not, you can barely move around with your trolly or basket.

Apart from that, it does have a great and cheap selection of food and free parking.",Aldi
58,Chaotic. Trying to buy special buy item that was supposed to be in stock last Tuesday. Item not in stock and not listed on dellayed items list. Visited stores for five days in a row with no success. Staff unable to help. A disaster. Finally gave up,Aldi
59,Always great deals and lots of variety,Aldi
60,"They don't always have everything stocked and I wish they had a better section for canned goods, but it's okay I guess. The staff here are really nice though",Aldi
61,Presentation of the store when entering not very clean...More staff just packing shelfs..House keeping needs to be looked at..The fresh fruit section needs to be looked at..picked up so called fresh strawberrys looked under the package full of green mold..informed floor manager she was no more intrested in what I was saying...She just kept packing shelfs...Over all 3/10 on shop experience...,Aldi
62,Good stock levels. Handy parking and no queue at checkout. Was also able to get a lotto ticket at the checkout which I had not seen in an Aldi before and was impressed with this.,Aldi
63,"Normally shop in Aldis in Kells, where it is clean, and organized. I would happily give Kells 5 stars. This one in Santry was none of these. It was dirty, stock was disorganized and needed tidying on the shelves. It was difficult to find anything. Only good thing was that the staff were curteous.",Aldi
64,Nearly every item in store stretches your euro further I'd say if aldis delivered it would smoke any of the other competition outta the water cheap isn't the word depends on what the customer is looking for if u drink alco from heavey booze to low fat wine its your 1 stop shop foods great don't mind the ads on tv bring 20e with you a list a few bags  r your own trolley  one of them granda yolks savage,Aldi
65,A good shop in a good location until you get asked for €2 for the bus home at the door by some locals who always happen to be short for the bus stop right outside:) :) :) Tip: don't give them bus fare you are only enabling them :),Aldi
66,"After years of lying about their animal testing practices, Aldi own brand products are no longer tested on animals, and even have the Leaping Bunny label.

They have a great vegan range - ""no beef"" burgers, ""no chicken"" burgers, sausage rolls, spicy bean burgers, soy milk, almond milk, and a great selection of fruit, veg, grains, nuts and seeds. They are lacking vegan cheese, yogurt and ice cream, although they do a couple of sorbets that are cruelty free.

Lovely staff - cheerful and helpful. Always low prices and quality fruit and vegetables.",Aldi
67,"This is a staff review only!
I am always in Aldi's once every 2 weeks doing my daily shop. I went in on Saturday 25th of May 2019 twice and went to the same staff member on till number five. Once was my few bits and a box of Budweiser with my sister of 22 years of age getting a different transaction. I am 23 years of age, had ID with me and because I was talking to my sister who had no ID with her, I was refused the box of Budweiser. Only because I was with my sister who had no ID with her. I then went back for a bottle of liquor and the staff member was so rude. He had the red light on hes till while still sitting at hes till and a que at the other till which was open. I asked the staff member at till 5 was he closed and he said yes. So I walked to the other till and while I was at the other till 1 minute later he reopened hes till. While being served the way he spoke to me was so rude, this man is only new and so rude!",Aldi
68,"Is very handy to go after work or after the gym. The prices are ok and you can find a lot of Irsih products. Is not the best place to buy fish, if you don't eat it the same day hight chance to be gone  instead of the date.",Aldi
69,"Not very impressed. Staff always look and feel like they're being forced to be there, they're not very friendly. A lot of the product is sometimes off in the packet. Premises clean and tidy.",Aldi
70,Great value,Aldi
71,I always shop here it's great value and food bill is slashed dramatically can't fault only one thing I don't like is the fact I get gift vouchers and  I have to spend every cent because aldi won't give you back change its a bit degrading and also I can never get a small trolley other than that the food is great value,Aldi
72,"Probably  my favourite  shop, situated on East Wall Rd ,plenty of parking either here or across the road in Lidl, good range of food stuff, easy to move around in,staff very helpful, shelf always seemed to be stacked, plenty of tills for check out.",Aldi
73,Pretty good store and a big one for that. Prices are seriously competitive as compared to nearby Tesco and Lidl stores. 5 Stars for me.,Aldi
74,"Good prices but no customer service you don't get a second to pack your bags they always have pallets on the floor staff would never think of moving them out of the way when I mentioned it to a member of staff I was told ""thats the way we work""",Aldi
75,Can be a little bit and miss with the selection of fresh produce.  Also can be slower than normal at tills as the staff love to chat with each other. Overall it's a good Aldi,Aldi
76,Very nice place to do shopping in Aldi. The prices are affordable. I recommend everyone to shopping there.,Aldi
77,"No decent fruit ,shop very untidy and badly managed as far as I can see .",Aldi
78,Regular store for all house hold groceries and stuff. You get a lot of options too. Keep looking at their brochures online to know what new items will be available for special buys.,Aldi
79,"Pointless having parent and child parking if their own security guards cars are going to occupy them.
In store staff etc all good.",Aldi
80,"Love shopping in Aldi. Great value, great products & some fantastic added extras each week. Fresh fruit & veg always well presented, along with great bargains in the meat area. Definitely recommend trying out your weekly shop there....you will be very surprised at how much youll save at the till.",Aldi
81,"All you need at a fraction of the price.
We live 2 minutes away so it relevant3and easy to use.
As i said,it has everything you need at a fraction of the price.",Aldi
82,"Great shop always preferred Aldi's than Lidl, prices are very cheap and get a trolley full for around €60-€70. Also does great deals on your gardening equipment and work clothes and gym clothes and electrical appliance..",Aldi
83,Good value never too busy excellent staff always a pleasant shopping experience,Aldi
84,"Very busy store, not entirely sure its well staffed, as it may or may not be replenished as the day goes on, I have had strange encounters with the staff at times asking for items.",Aldi
85,"Typical Aldi, usual offers and extra fresh veg. Any que and they open extra tills so pushes through fairly quickly compared to other stores!",Aldi
86,"Stock levels can be very low in the afternoons/evenings, especially for fresh fruit and vegetables.
The store are good for managing queue levels at the tills.",Aldi
87,Great place to do your weekly shopping never over crowded nice staff good food.,Aldi
88,"Good place to do your quick shopping, but I give 4 stars, every time I go there, there is one major item they are out of.",Aldi
89,"Good shop very reasonable prices , veg is top quality and since it was extended the aisles are far more spaces",Aldi
90,"This is a standard Aldi store, good for buying your shopping and offers a range of special offers weekly. Has a decent sized car park and trolleys are always available.",Aldi
91,"Founded by Mr Al D. Albrecht, he once found himself stuck on a snowy road, blocked by a tree, starving and no light around to see what he was doing. He thought to himself, I wish there was a shop where I could get some food, some ski gear to get back easier, a chainsaw to cut the tree and some new headlamps for my car. Aldi was now born. He did though seem to have something against people who collect shopping trolleys, at €2 to use a trolley, that's double what other shops charge, if a collector wants to take it home to keep he will lose his €2. This branch in particular compensates this with loads of free parking, is well stocked with everything and the staff are friendly and helpful too.

Note: Although this story might not be true, some facts remain. The store does stock everything from your weekly shop to power tools, ski gear and all sorts of gadgets you don't really need but will buy anyway. It is €2 for a trolley compared to the standard €1 slot, parking is free and stock is always good.",Aldi
92,The new layout is grand.apart from.loads food products out of date.was raw chicken and turkeys gone off by 3 days.coleslaw aswell.told a girl at checkout and she looked at me like I had 10 heads.wont shop tere again.,Aldi
93,"The business itself is fine, some of the customers are not so much. I actually felt uncomfortable at one stage. Maybe it was just a once off.",Aldi
94,What's the good having disabled ♿ spaces if full of lazy people.  Please start checking cars for disabled badges and clamping them if none.,Aldi
95,"I love Aldi but this one is lacking in friendliness if the staff are not happy its not my fault not is it Aldi. Some staff seem to take it upon themselves to be negative and appear to be put out by the customers. I heard this said in a place I worked by a staff member ""Only for the customers this would be a great place to work"" I kid you not. If you are not happy where you work or your work makes you angry and or unhappy there is something you can do to solve your problem straight away.....LEAVE  now. You are not sentenced by a judge  to work in Aldi. Do not judge us customers we have the same fears as you do with life but for Christ's sake a smile is free a nice hello is free eye contact is free but it returns to you an abundance of joy. It takes serious effort to be unfriendly and you get it back in buckets and only you can change. ALDI please spend some time telling your staff this or just visit Lidl in Gullivers or Homebase or McDonald's or Home Focus or IKEA my God the lessons are free and easy to learn. Even my dog can train them just look at him....you see nice is good.",Aldi
96,"Went looking for a particular item, appears to be no longer available, but there was a substitute item available. Good price items, different from traditional Irish household items, but are just as good and cheaper.",Aldi
97,"Addi is great to shop in if you know exactly what you are looking for. Unfortunately you will not get ma y of the big ne items, but having said that their own brand it's are mostly of a high standard at a far lesser price. Another disadvantage is at times they run out of stock of their most popular items. Another advantage in shopping with Aldi is their free parking. If you purchase Aldi brand goods they are of a high standard at a far lesser price.  They do not have a bakery like Lidl",Aldi
98,"Usually smooth shopping stop, definitely appreciate the less pricey stuff, my best shoes come from here, interesting deli and dairy products, so we come to Aldi often",Aldi
99,"Nice and quiet in the store, it's a shame the carpark was a nightmare,, very hard pushing your trolly through  a stone /pebble path",Aldi
100,"Nice tidy shop, very good checkout staff, not crowded so a pleasure to shop thei",Aldi
101,"Busy store. Wide Isles, great for social distancing.  The middle Isle is a killer though. Mind your wallet, so many great deals in the middle Isle.🤣 …",Aldi
102,"New Layout

103,"Do my main shop here, always enjoy browsing the tool section. Had a fantastic deal on sandpaper recently so I stocked up.",Aldi
104,"Loads of stock, slightly discouraged from returning with someone outside asking for change",Aldi
105,Good parking availability. One is never queuing too long at busy times.,Aldi
106,"Easy parking, cheaper prices, good service, what more do you want ?",Aldi
107,"Surprised at the amount of customers not wearin masks tonight in Aldi Coolock? Thursday 20th August, thought it was Mandatory? I have seen customers stopped by staff in Dunnes Stores and asked to put a mask on, which is only right considering the current rise in Covid cases, surprised that there was no policing of it in Aldi as such.",Aldi
108,Aldi is quite a nice place to shop. Most items are affordable and the staff are also nice. I think the safety of the customers and their staff is a priority.,Aldi
109,Do our shipping here most of the times. Always stocked and friendly staff,Aldi
110,Lots of tills open when I was there.  Plenty of free spaces to park and I felt safe enough with the Covid19 measures put in place.,Aldi
111,"Not one of Aldi's best stores,had someone ask me for money outside",Aldi
112,"Aldi is great place to shop it has everthing under one roof , very nice staff if need to find anything , best time to shop is early mornings or late evening before it closes at 10 . More quiet then . Great places",Aldi
113,"Well stocked staff, policy on returns on bigger items that are only sold by aldi is silly and needs to be changed. But generally a very good shop.",Aldi
114,"Not bad,many cheep items such are food,hygiene products and other...just I couldn't find a cigarettes 😩 …",Aldi
115,"Great own brand produce, fresh breads daily, ample parking and unbelievable prices!",Aldi
116,The best (and cheapest) market in this area. Nice staff and wide range of products. Clean and well organized shop.,Aldi
117,Cool collection. Good prices on frozen section.  Dileveroo at door delivery available as well.,Aldi
118,"I like Aldi! I know where everything is. The staff are    helpful and courteous.  And they have high trolleys , important if you are an older shopper.",Aldi
119,It is very big and spacious since it had a make over. Staff are very friendly.,Aldi
120,Handy to shop in any time of the year,Aldi
121,Good place to go shopping for food. Does not have a great variety but it is definitely cheaper then most of the places.  Could be more organised.,Aldi
122,This was amazing and cheap really people are nice too and very interesting this shopping is better what we need for the dinner or lunch or party,Aldi
123,"I went to my local Aldi store in Clonmel today. I do 90 percent of my weekly shopping there. I regularly by their ground coffee, especially their ethiopian blend which would be my favourite. I bought 3 bags about 2 weeks ago and opened one and used a few spoons to brew a pot as normal and it was undrinkable. My friend also buys this blend and found the same awful taste. When I asked the manager in Clonmel if I could exchange the unopened bags for a different blend I was told that unless I had my reciept this wasn't possible.
Now this is an Aldi product and I CANT buy it in any other store. Will someone tell me why I can't exchange them. Very poor customer service indeed for one of their most regular customers.",Aldi

1,"Lots of free underground parking spaces. Shop is very clean, bright and open. A good selection of fruit and veg, meat, snacks and household items. No queues on the till. I really like this shop",Aldi
2,"A nice store as far as Aldi stores go. It is clean and well organized. I'm simply not a fan of this chain. Every time I enter a store I feel like I'm at an organized rummage sale. The goods are very eclectic. Clothes, cleaners and vegetables are sometimes found in the same aisle. They do have good prices though.",Aldi
3,"Unfortunately, I had a very unpleasant experience while shopping at one of your stores today. At approximately 1:45 pm, yesterday I was checking out and had one bag of lemons left to pack when the cashier began to rush me and even went so far as to scan my items onto the ground without any apology. I am unsure if this behavior was due to my slower packing speed, the cashier's personal mood, or even discrimination. However, the store was not particularly busy at the time, and I believe I was packing at a reasonable pace. I would appreciate a reasonable explanation for this behavior.",Aldi
4,"Empty, no crowds on sat morning.

They don't have sparkling water only still one. Unless you buy the big 2.5l bottles. But no single 0.5l-1l bottles with sparkling water. Which means it's a shop for poor people.",Aldi
5,"(Verse 1)
Yo, step into Aldi, where the deals never cease,
Every aisle's a treasure trove, grabbin' bargains with ease.
From fresh produce to snacks, they got all you need,
Quality and value, yeah, that's Aldi's creed.

(Chorus)
Aldi, oh Aldi, where the prices stay low,
Every aisle's a journey, every shelf's a gold mine, yo.
Pantry to freezer, they got all in stock,
At Aldi, every shopping trip's a block-rock.

(Verse 2)
Rollin' through the store with my cart, feelin' fly,
Explorin' every section, watchin' prices fly by.
From cheeses to chocolates, and wine so fine,
Aldi's got the goods, makin' every moment prime.

(Chorus)
Aldi, oh Aldi, where the prices stay low,
Every aisle's a journey, every shelf's a gold mine, yo.
Pantry to freezer, they got all in stock,
At Aldi, every shopping trip's a block-rock.

(Bridge)
No fancy labels needed, just quality stuff,
At Aldi, keepin' it real, ain't no fluff.
Savings stackin' up, smiles never cease,
In these budget-friendly aisles, we find our peace.

(Verse 3)
Checkin' out at the counter, bags packed tight,
Countin' up the savings, feelin' alright.
Still got cash in my pocket, heart full of glee,
Aldi, you're the MVP, you're the place to be.

(Chorus)
Aldi, oh Aldi, where the prices stay low,
Every aisle's a journey, every shelf's a gold mine, yo.
Pantry to freezer, they got all in stock,
At Aldi, every shopping trip's a block-rock.

(Outro)
So raise a toast to Aldi, our favorite spot,
Where savings and smiles are never forgot.
In the aisles of Aldi, where joy always reigns,
Here's to Aldi, where every trip entertains.",Aldi
6,"Despite doing the family shop here once per week plus more for mid week to ups, was unfortunately clamped in the carpark. Not a great way to thank loyal customers!",Aldi
7,"Low stock levels, no any fresh bread, no proper price labels for the products. Store looks mess, couldn't find what i looked for. I had to shop in there because lidl was closed but won't go there anymore. Don't recommend at all.",Aldi
8,"Quite a dirty entrance from the car park, and there has been a leak in the roof of the entrance area for years. No maintenance/repair work seems to be done, or at least very irregularly, which is a pity as it’s a nice old restored tram station.

Food etc selection is all the usual stuff for an Aldi, but the fresh veg options are often quite limited with no salad,  cucumbers, or spring onions regularly.",Aldi
9,Great value and products- lovely staff too,Aldi
10,Lovely staff. Easy to park. Love to shop here.,Aldi
11,"Lovely staff, helpful, efficient, effective and welcoming.  Happy to direct you to whatever you are looking for, or check in the store, to see if they have it for you.  I'm happy to recommend the staff in this store!!!!

Happier to go back to this store!!!!!",Aldi
12,Nice place where you can find a lot at a cheap price.,Aldi
13,"I went looking for frozen stuffed mini naan breads, as recommended by a friend, but couldn’t find them. Picked up some of those vegan burgers which I have since made and they were very nice.",Aldi
14,"I love Aldi, however I find some people in Terenure Aldi to be quite rude. Customers don't seem pleasant and hardly acknowledge you trying to get by with your trolley. Long mile Aldi for me !",Aldi
15,"ALDI will always be ALDI, neat, orderly and helpful staff. They stock lots of goodies especially seasonal and the cash out lanes are quick to open as more customers queue up. One of the best benefit to this store is the underground free parking. Kudos to ALDI",Aldi
16,"Thank you. I'm a chef. Tonight I have cooked chicken breast stuffed with Roqufort, garlic Irish Butter, and panchetta in breadcrumbs. With roasted baby potatoes and dressed salad , followed by black cherry cheesecake made with mascapone,cremfrais, icing sugar etc. Quality ingredients producing restaurant quality meals at a small price.",Aldi
17,"I have never bought bananas or nectarines that weren’t brown on the inside or rotten. Every. Single. Time.

The rest of the store is pretty good.",Aldi
18,"A excellent supermarket to buy all your groceries and day to day necessary items. A well stocked, well presented supermarket. Fantastic produce, in fruits, vegetables, meats and all  requirement. A must visit! Wheelchair accessibility and parking available. Strict COVID measures followed. I loved it!!!👍🤗 …",Aldi
19,"Good shop, nice building.",Aldi
20,Absolute shambles of a place. Our preordered items for Christmas Dinner were not available when we collected at 6pm on the 23rd December and had to source all major items on Christmas eve. An absolute disgrace. No explanation no alternatives. Whoever is responsible for inventory control in ALDI needs to take their head out of the sand and start paying attention to the basic inventory control fundamentals. It's not good enough. We won't shop here ever again which has cost them around €600 per month.,Aldi
21,"My favourite Aldi anywhere! WIde aisles,well stocked, easy and free parking, central to Terenure, it has everything you can ever want... I even found a mandoline there last time!!",Aldi
22,"Although the expiration date of yogurt has passed 10 days ago, it is sold on the shelves! If the yogurt was not runny, I would have eaten it and I would have been poisoned (maybe?). I thought to take the yoğurt to aldı but it would be more expensive than yoğurt price:D Some breads are sold just before their expiration date(20/09/2022). They should definitely pay attention to this situation.  In general, I prefer it because it is affordable products with certain standards.",Aldi
23,"Shopped at Aldi Terenure today. A special word of thanks to Store Manager (Sean?)in charge today, Saturday 25th June, with how he handled a mix up in price with an item on the bill....excellent customer service!
Overall, a great store with great staff!",Aldi
24,"Generally great it has what you would need groceries sweets and also has a wide catalog of many things
ect. Big store and would recommend",Aldi
25,Great value for your shopping. Ready to eat meals are quite tasty for when you're feeling lazy but still want something tasty and comforting. Big bargain deals every week.,Aldi
26,"It's another Aldi so for what it is and what you'd expect it is perfectly fine. Staff are quite friendly at the till which is nice. Pity there's not more bagging space, but that's Aldi for you. Good car parking here also.",Aldi
27,"Spacious discount supermarket. Good range of products, very good quality beef and lamb.  Very nice staff.  Spacious aisles, convenient car parking and located in what used to be the local tram depot.",Aldi
28,This my favourite local grocery shop. It has pretty much everything you would need in your everyday shopping. There's always plenty of parking and the staff are friendly and helpful too.,Aldi
29,Never too busy and even when it is busy you never have to wait long at the tills. You still have to put up with the machine gun speed of check out but always a nice experience and Aldi's prices are the lowest around,Aldi
30,"It has very good and fresh products, its promotions are also good and you generally find everything",Aldi
31,Cashier was most unhelpful. When I asked her to progress the belt to tighten up the gap she told me there was room in the middle which is exactly what I was trying to get rid of   When I told her that I was going to report her she shrugged her shoulders as if devil may care. Never again - back to Tesco's Why do people like this get jobs in service industries?,Aldi
32,ALDI are just amazing when it comes to variety of food at really fair prices. I did hear it was a place to avoid buying meat. Being quite a big consumer of steak I find theirs to be of a high grade with such a reasonable price. Location is very handy as it is surrounded by really well know and heavily populated areas. Couldn't recommend more.,Aldi
33,"It's a good spot for this shop, but they are not that well stocked with products. Many a times they are out of veggies if you visit them after 6:30 pm. Also, the shop has lot less options to buy compared to its brother Lidl on the other side of the road. Their offers and deals for Christmas is also not that great.",Aldi
34,"In general, I like Aldi stores. They have a nice selection of fresh food, as well as household essentials.  This store is built inside a restored tram shed,  so it is a particularly nice building. There is plenty of free parking underneath, a big deal in Terenure, where street parking is hard to find.",Aldi
35,Best value! Not as crowded as the other shops.,Aldi
36,It's my favourite Aldi branch the one in Terenure I'm so happy with their service friendliness tidiness..they have a wide variety of home items too.. I have nothing to complain about the staff is professional respectful and friendly.,Aldi
37,"Just like a normal Aldi, size of the Aldi is also same, its one of the organized Aldi i know, you have ample of parking space too and if you don't find anything you can go to Lidl which is just across the road.",Aldi
38,"Good groceries shopping with covid-19 guidelines followed. I have been to Aldi multiple times as this is my regular groceries store. As far as I have seen, during weekdays the crowd increases post 4pm. And weekends the crowd fluctuates. For safer shopping I would recommend going between 10am to 2pm. Hope my review helps and wish you a safe shopping.",Aldi
39,"Aldi - Terenure ( located on the Terenure Rd East ) I would highly highly recommend this particular Aldi for the following reasons:

• The Staff are just so professional, helpful and there's a nice team spirit that one  can intuitively feel when after you visit on a couple of occasions.  -

• Some other Aldis won't have get the  ""Special - buys"" that Terenure seem to always stock.

• The store is spacious, airy, and merchandised well.

• I particularly appreciate and I'm sure  most regular customers would too is that the aisle(s)are exactly - almost to a tee in line with the cashier, and hence no confusion about where to stand when it's crowded.

• The staff ALWAYS open another cashier or 2 if needs be- when the queues get long, and they'll announce it over the inter - com.

•  Aldi Terenure is the best Aldi I know especially for older ,or wheelchair bound people(s) because the staff are very quick at scanning items through the checkout and in the current difficult climate we 're living in, its a fair assumption to think most people (s) prefer the face- to face -contact with the cashiers.as opposed to the self- checkouts . •

•I've noticed there is a very pleasant  comaderie between the staff  & it's most definitely a very well organised and  efficiently run shop.
I thnk it's fair to say all the staff are consistently pleasant and go above and beyond to ensure the  shopping experience f the customer is as stress free, and as pleasant as  possible. This is evidenced by the familiar faces you often see doing their daily/ weekly shop.

•Aldi Terenure is a spacious, airy shop with wide aisles ( so ideal for  wheel chair bound  accessible customers)
•Most items - essential anyway  are at arms reach.

•There are 2 wide  escalators which lead to the underground car park with ample parking.
•well sign - posted and designed.

•As it is one of their larger shops.( perhaps their flagship shop)  it is always well stocked;  from essential items to special buys.

• The special buys sometimes sell out within hrs ..and it's not unusual to see a queue forming early ( even prior to the Covid virus) .....

A clear testament to the superior  quality of their ""limited special buys "" whuch are marketed on the Aldi App & in  paper format circa 2 weeks before arrival .

•Great buys at a fraction of the cost of some of the more smaller retailers, who wouldnt have the same buying power As Aldi.

• I don't agree the quality isn't as good as Super- Valu or Mortons Ranelagh or even M&S - Absolute Rubbish.

Just a convenience shop-  targeting a different type of consumer -convenient shopping, as opposed to an planned strategic shop to Aldi or Lidl.

•They even have artisan soups, meals for one - the best of quality and at 1/2 the price  of what you would pay in artisan shops.

•They also have a lovely selection of wines at 1/2  the price of other retailers.

(•I do think that Lidl Terenure do stock a better selection of wines - overall.
Perhaps something a little bit more exciting for that 'special occasion'- and yet Aldi have a lovely selection of Old -World and New- World at very reasonable prices.

•I think that Aldi could afford and have the space for a small fridge to  sell chilled wines- just constructive feedback..

•Apart from those 2 points aforementioned- it's a great store, Supporting Irish producers aswell - which is vital to our country's economy.

• AlDI - Exceedingly good quality at 1/2 the price. That's savings that u can spend on a break down the west ! For 21. Or abroad perhaps for 2022.

•The only product I do really miss is ' Vanish' the original ( in bar, liquid, for carpets and spray for preaching stained clothes)

""Jif.""Not the lemon one, the white one is a must aswell! I go to dealz for it.

•Well done 'Aldi Terenure' abd to all the staff .  You have being super throughout the pandemic-and customers really appreciate it .

•All in all, an extremely well run store with exceptionally, efficient & pleasant staff & management.

Thank you.

I would highly highly recommend Aldi 👏👏👏",Aldi
40,"My local shopping place, Aldi is amazing for quality and prices in general but this one is one of the biggest, has a big underground car park and the staff are amazing, always in great humor. The only downside is getting out of the car park on to the road as there's quite a high traffic on that road and drivers tend to not respect the yellow box.",Aldi
41,Always a pleasure shopping here. Great parking and all storage areas very tidy. Air- conditioning excellent and a very pleasant young man (with beard) at the checkout.,Aldi
42,"This location has a free, dedicated underground parking lot in a renovated beautiful old building. I like the direction Aldi have been going with having more Health Foods and catering to specialty diets and highly recommend their almond milk and fat free Greek yoghurt which are cheaper but comparable to brand name products.",Aldi
43,"Professional and bright store kept clean and well-stocked. Pro tip: trollies are magnetically locked to the travellator floor so standing behind one on the way up from the car park will take ages. Instead, take the lift to the left of the main entrance.",Aldi
44,"I like this Aldi because of the size, the parking and the friendly staff.Shopping has turned into a bit of a marathon these days during Covid 19.I like the way the cashiers are patient and attentive.No rushing through your groceries when you are frantically trying to retrieve them from the trolley.It makes the nightmare if shopping for two households as pleasant as it can be.",Aldi
45,"It's Aldi, reassuringly consistent across the board, everything you need under one roof ☺️",Aldi
46,I can't tell the difference between Didl and Ladi but the middle aisle is a cornucopia of things powered by rechargeable batteries that play music flavoured like chocolate.,Aldi
47,I'm new to Aldi shopping and this is a new store in Terenure. I enjoy it - it was never been full when i go shopping so it makes for an easy quick shop. Staff at tills are very nice here and quickly open new till if need arises - food selection and quality is very good - although you might need to visit anothet shop for some more specislity items. Would recommend.,Aldi
48,"Stunning store that incorporates the old tram station keeping the old brickwork with a modern design. The store itself has wide aisles, happy approachable staff and great prices. Great addition to Terenure",Aldi
49,"ALDI!! Where is there to start! Such a great shop!!
Personally I think the fruit and vegetables are of amazing quality. They have a wide selection of biscuits, bread, dairy & meat! They have anything you could want!
Their own-brand food also tastes very good, I reccomend their houmous!",Aldi
50,I’m starting to go off Aldi now as every time I find some good flavours for cooking a week or two later they are gone and never to be seen again. Also they just keep changing locations of products too often so you can’t find what you went for so I just walk out and some staff pull a face if you ask. Thanks Aldi for the past but I think I’ll have to go elsewhere. Shame really as they had some great products but just disappear 😳,Aldi
51,"I could find nearly everything I was looking for, but I don't like the fact that even felt and vegetables are nearly always packed up in non recyclable packaging. It would be nice to be able to find more unpacked stuff or at least that the packaging would be recyclable.",Aldi
52,"Spacious with plenty of parking.
Great location. We'll stocked",Aldi
53,"Good cheap prices but sometimes the choices of products can be limited

And Aldi’s grapes are also particularly crisp and sweet.",Aldi

1,"This is a huge store. Its location is superb. Just outside the aldi there is luas stop and a bus stop. This aldi has best connectivity. Prices are great and groceries here cost 20-30% less than other stores. They have huge varieties of chips, tea, coffee and muffins. One should also explore their personal care section many products are available at good prices such as shaving blades, shampoo, handwash, body lotion, cream etc. They also have huge bakery segment and their buns arr very delicious. One should try their brioche buns at 1.39 euro they also have muffin box at 1.49 euro each box has approx 18 muffins. Their vegetables and fruits section is also nice and have fresh produce. Their ready to eat food offerings are nice and one should try ready to eat egg rice packets also. For vegetarian clients they have delicious vegetable spring rolls. They also have meal boxes with rice and different curries 🍛 from 2.5 to 3.5 euro. Poppadums are available here at 0.69 euro which is cheapest. This is a must try store and shopping here will save huge in grocery bill. 😀",Aldi
2,"This may be the right review or may be an unfair review.

I rarely visit this particular store. Usually the staff is very welcoming, a bit slow on the queues so isn’t ideal if you’re shopping in your break time. The store usually has stock.

This review regards one product they have in store: Pomelo Blossom & Musk Handmade Scented Candle. The candle is in a beautiful container. Today I found only the container without the candle, in conclusion half product. I asked the cashier if this product will be charged full price or there will be a discount as it may be considered faulty. I’ve been charged the full price. Isn’t there a discount on faulty items?

From a different Aldi store I bought a dying Bouquet of roses because I only needed the petals. They charged full price again for a bouquet which was gonna be thrown in the bin. Quality price seem to be an issue sometimes.

To whom may I address this concern? No fresh rosemary in this Aldi, is not a tragedy but still… why is it missing? You’re more than welcome to see this review as a constructive one! I hope you enjoy your time! 🙂",Aldi

8,"It may be nothing to look at but it sure has better prices than pretty much all the other stores including dunns, lidl and Tesco. Dynns and Tesco probably have more variety but it's a slightly higher price. Aldi is just what I need from my requirements and just the right price. Although for fruits and veggies id go for Tesco or dunns.",Aldi
9,"Great location, The foodstuff are well  priced and I specially loved the prawns definitely my favourite place to get prawns . The staffs are also friendly, willing to help and professional.  I would strongly recommend ALDI to anyone. I can't overemphasize the great prices with everyone in mind .",Aldi
10,Used to be good brutal now because prices have gone through the roof and worst of all if you have a lot of shopping you would want to be like Speedy Gonzalez putting your shopping into bags because they literally rush you through the place god love old age pensioners how they manage I do not know,Aldi

13,"Fantastic deal this week. My favourite fruit is on the Super 6 offer

THE GOLDEN KIWI......sweet...juicy...you just cannot get enough of this!

Green on the outside and golden yellow on the inside.

I only eat this fruit when it is a bit soft to light pressure....from my experience...the softer...the sweeter.
Eat this on its own or make a smooty with other frozen fruit from Aldi. You will not go wrong!!

New Zealand golden kiwi is sweeter than the European variety....

Alright everyone....grab a pack or two while the going is good!!!",Aldi

21,"One of my favourite places for shopping for daily groceries. Good quality products and great taste. You also have fruits and veggies and icecream, along meat products. Also prepared foods like pasta and chicken korma. You can also find home items (sheets), toiletry and even tools. Free parking usually, with easy access.",Aldi
22,"I really enjoy shopping here, the staff are nice and friendly and they have many good products, sometimes it feels tightening in the aisles when there are so many people and trolleys in such a small space and I also feel like it would be an even greater store if it were to have self checkout areas, just sometimes a staff member or two will look at a full trolley and close their tills even though the person had already been in their queue and ready to go next, I'd say that's the only thing they could really improve on, other than that it's a brilliant store :)",Aldi
23,Certainly..well packed shelves. Good carpark. Lanes are a little tight. Whole experience a bit claustrophobic. As usual great value for our shopping.,Aldi
24,"A pleasure to shop here. Although it's a massive shop with many locations, the staff here make it feel very welcoming and friendly with almost a village shop feel to it",Aldi
25,I like Aldi and I always shop there but one of the workers today we're so rude to me when I asked him about something I couldn't find..he looked at me with not a very nice look! And he showed me the section where I might find what I want! And not even helping me find it... I was about to tell him that I know this section but I couldn't find the thing I need but he didn't even give me the chance.. His voice tone and body language were not professional. I don't know if he is racist or something but I clearly know he was upset that I asked him for something.,Aldi
26,"I really enjoyed shopping in Aldi. The experience was very much great. They have good range of products. The customer service isn't the best. However, I really enjoyed my time shopping here. The store is in a great location. I would definitely recommend shopping here if you are on a budget.",Aldi
27,"Aldi is a great retailer, good prices and a very interesting variety of products. Their quality of packaged goods and store brand products equals or exceeds competitors. Their meats also tend to be very good. Their staff are well trained and usually very helpful.

However they are often let down by their fresh produce. Most times the fruit and veg are somewhat bland or lacking in flavor, and are almost always unripe. I understand that freezing produce for transport can impact the flavor, but I am not sure that's the only issue (I think it's a practice shared by many retailers ). One other issue is their product rotation, sometimes they have something, sometimes they don't and you never know when it will be back in (and neither do their staff).

However, their wine and beer selection is surprisingly good and generally beats their competitors easily in the same price bracket!",Aldi
28,Nice big spacious store with all the mods and cons have an Aldi store.,Aldi
29,Its a supermarkt....its well stocked and reasonable..,Aldi
30,Very good! Sometimes to busy for the number of employees working!,Aldi
31,"They charged my credit card 2 times, stated that problems with the systems and asked to pay cash or use another card and promised don't charge the previous 2 transactions.  So I ended payment 3 times for my shopping .  Very bad customer service.  Good prices? but you have to pay 3 times... VERY EXPENSIVE, do shopping in another place that really care about the customer",Aldi
32,"This shop is very near to Stillorgan luas stop, max 5 wins walk. It is a nice shop to buy groceries. Although, there is no self checkout system here which sometimes leads to long queues.",Aldi
33,Good value in today's world of rising prices....making an effort to keep items as reasonable as possible. Thank you,Aldi
34,Well stocked. Pleasant and quick service at the till.,Aldi
35,"It's clean and well maintained store. Covid compliant. There is a drive in car park just in case you are not from that area, but it's pitty they don't have a bicycle parking area, maybe there is but it's definitely far away from the entrance.",Aldi
36,"Very good staff and customers service, really helpful with queries and returns. Fruit and veg are generally well stocked and a reasonable percent are available without plastic packaging. Hoping to see less plastic in the future.",Aldi
37,There is definitely more choice in the Stillorgan Aldi compared to Sallynogin on. Only not fully stocked! Could be cause its Sunday evening and a lot of shoppers traffic could be there 🤔 …,Aldi
38,"Great prices and good variety. This branch is my favourite. Plenty of parking, good fruit and veg and plenty of quality meat. You can fill the trolley for a lot less than elsewhere.",Aldi
39,"Same type fruits and other edibles are higher prices in other supermarkets comparatively. At the same time, quality of the other products like shoes / clothes, etc,..are not up to the mark. A normal stroller is( 99.9) really a high price in this place.
Crockery items are also not good quality one.
I suggest this place to buy only for edibles.",Aldi
40,Not sure if this was an express store but it had most basic items I needed. The laundromat vending machines in the parking are very convenient,Aldi
41,"As always, lovely staff and excellent service. Would like delivery option on heavy goods, for example, I wanted to purchase a cordless Lawnmower that was a really good price,but I have no way of transporting it as I walk & use public transport.",Aldi
42,"Great for parking, friendly,helpful staff.",Aldi
43,"Cheap groceries in reasonable price, great site for shopping since there’s an indoor car park, best for rainy seasons. Great selection of food and home goods.",Aldi
44,Very convenient one-stop shop in Sandyford/Stillorgan. All essential groceries catered for.,Aldi
45,"Good fast service, with new tills opened as soon as lines of longer than 3 forming.
Reasonably good selection, although sometimes the shelves in the veg section are empty at the weekend. Not sure what that has to do with.",Aldi
46,I expected more from the Trader Joe's parent company but this place is bargain basement prices and quality. They had everything if you were willing to look and hunt.,Aldi
47,Aldi should insist and reinforce that customers do not pack bags at the checkout… there are areas specially allocated to this and people who insist on packing a weeks family grocery into individual bags at the checkout are rather selfish. The checkouts need better management.,Aldi
48,"The address, curiously (for me, anyway) is The Boulevard at Rockbrook - not Sandyford Industrial Estate. Another quick visit today. Fairly accessible and quick parking - free, too. Efficient in-and-out. And I snagged the two items I wanted more or less immediately. The two members of staff I dealt with were knowledgeable and efficient. A very positive experience.",Aldi
49,Great produce and staff,Aldi
50,Really good value on the steaks mushrooms and onions spuds marafat peas one hell of a meal and great value 😋 …,Aldi
51,Best prices in town,Aldi
52,"As usual, Aldi Sandyford at 10 am Sunday is fully stocked. All goods are of high quality and offer a good variation. Extremely friendly, helpful staff. Always enjoy my experience there.",Aldi
53,"A large grocery store located conveniently near Stillorgan LUAS and Beacon South Quarter. 90 minutes free car park is also available for shoppers. The stop stocks almost all regular grocery items right from fruits, vegetables, frozen food, dairy, meat, alcohol to many more. COVID protocols are followed well.",Aldi
54,"Great location, plenty of parking and friendly service. Only critique I would make is they need more tills open at peak times because you could be left waiting 10-15 mins queuing which isn't ideal at lunchtime.",Aldi
55,"Ramp going up the parking is LETHAL!!! Why such a severe incline?! Wrecked my front bumper, even when going at it from a 45 degree angle. They need to fix that because it's unnecessarily steep and prevents lower or sportier cars from being able to use the parking.",Aldi
56,It's pretty good. No longer waiting for baskets and quick to open new lanes when queues get long. Vegetables need inspection before adding to basket.,Aldi
57,Handy free parking under cover to avoid the rain,Aldi
58,Disappointing visit. Went to buy the advertised wooden planter but they were tiny 😡 so not at all suitable for my garden. But some other great buys there but not for me today so a bit if a wasted journey. …,Aldi
59,"I shop here every week and for the most part find the staff to be very helpful, however it would be a more plesent experience if all the staff at the checkouts would wait until my trolly was at the till before checking any goods through...much simpler for everyone and nothing ends up on the floor.",Aldi
60,Staff are always super pleasant and are always quick to open tills before the queues get too long. Definitely my go-to Aldi.,Aldi
61,It us good place to shop your grocery and other limited time items that change from time to time. It is easily accessible  from luas stop too.,Aldi
62,"In proximity to our residence, good prices and products. Though not all are there. 😄👍 4/5 star down for tendency of staff to be grumpy (must have been work stress or Covid-19 precautionary maintenance 😉) …",Aldi
63,"Long queues, no cash machine, no cash back.
Even though I spent there more than enough money to get some football stickers for my kids, the cashier didn't give me any.
The other day, they didn't have any spelt and rye flour available.",Aldi
64,"I am a fan of Aldi but today I learned that cashiers are not required to cover their noses with their masks. The reason provided was that there is a screen in front of them. This screen does not extend to the sides. My semi masked cashier constantly touched his mask and then the produce. I did not feel safe in this Sandyford branch of Aldi, although customers were being careful and playing their part.
Update, April 2022: All very good now! 😊",Aldi
65,"Pleasant shopping experience, friendly staff 👍 But please add some self checkouts …",Aldi
66,"Excellent store with free parking which also has laundromat, parcel motel, carwash. Convenient opening hours.",Aldi
67,"Cheapest grocery store. Fruits in particular must be consumed with 2 days or they get bad. Except that, nice place to shop",Aldi
68,"Got scammed on Mother's day!! Bought 6 items mostly vegs,and checked the receipt - on 1st position was mineral water. The previous customer bought yougurt only. I got money back but the impression.. And it is not the first time when foreign cashier's are trying to scam,came across several cases -pay attention to what is in your receipt!!!",Aldi
69,"Staff is great and friendly. Shelves are stocked and tidy. Nice work ethic.
Medium size shop, no bakery.",Aldi
70,"Was having a bad morning - I have a 3 month old baby and I had gotten up at 7am (4hrs of broken sleep) and queued for 40mins outside aldi in nutgrove to buy the angelcare monitor. Although I was one of the first 8 people in the shop, they had all sold out. They only got in 5 monitors 😭. I was so disappointed, but headed up to aldi in sandyford just on the off chance they still had one. Loads of pregnant women leaving with trolleys full of baby special buys, and no sign of a monitor on the shelves. I resigned myself to the fact I'd have to pay the extra €100 for one, and did a small grocery shop. As I chatted to the cashier, Anca, who couldn't have been nicer, I told her about my bad luck in nutgrove and she went to check the store room to see if they had any monitors left. To my absolute delight she came back with one for me! Had Anca not been so warm and friendly  I wouldn't have known they still had some in stock and it really meant so much to me that she found one. Cannot praise her enough - she was so kind from the start of my interaction with her, until the end. Really made my day.",Aldi
71,"Never very busy. Well stocked. Friendly, helpful staff. Lots of parking. No baskets! According to the shop staff, customers frequently nick them and ALDI are fed up replacing them :-0",Aldi
72,Well stocked Aldi but not very well laid out. You have to keep coming back on yourself to go the whole way around the store. Also some parts of the store are very narrow and people can't get past each other with trolleys. Check out staff were nice and efficient as they always are in aldi.,Aldi
73,"Great for vegan options. Could do with more cleaning products that aren't tested on animals, and more transparency in advertising. Staff are always lovely.",Aldi
74,"Shopfloor dirty. Took 5 attempts to get a ""clean"" rolling basket. Heard one of the more senior staff tell a newbie, ""if you are unsure of stock just them it's not available today"".

Not a pleasant experience today I am afraid.",Aldi
75,"This branch of Aldi keeps making errors at the till. Three times in the past three weeks, I have had to go back to the store after realising that some items were scanned twice / double charged. This has happened occasionally at this store before, but is now a frequent occurrence. I don't know if it's a problem with staff training or a scam to rip people off. If you are shopping at this store, check your receipt before you leave the till / check out.",Aldi
76,Aldi sandy ford is a lovely well stocked supermarket.  Unfortunately due to recent changes with the car parking it is now impossible to shop here as the car park is used for all day commuter parking by Luas users.  The 3euro all day rate means Aldi customers have no access to free car park spaces.,Aldi
77,"Its an aldi. I'm no supershopper. But yeah a place incarnate of the 21st century super powers of competitive capitalism cliché and German stereotypes of improved service.

Its nice airy place. Staff are business like, deliver there job. So so much stuff like gardening and tool kits they sell. Going to be lucky enough to live near here soon and hoping to avail of every inch this place gifts comparable to exploitation elsewhere",Aldi
78,"Very quiet tonight, lots at home for the rugby .
Got all I needed,friendly till person too",Aldi
79,Their sell by dates are close to the edge! Still selling food items on best before date! Lidl don't!!!!....23 April...still selling meat with 22 April  on it!!!!,Aldi
80,Huge space everywhere with good bike parking spot. very well stocked stuffs,Aldi
81,"Enough of parking spaces, 90minutes free for customers. Nicely stocked but late in the evening you might not find some items as they  are not being restocked",Aldi
82,"Excellent supermarket. Terrific value, really good quality produce. Long opening hours, underground parking. Keep an eye out online for the weekly specials.",Aldi
83,First of all there is no natural light at all which makes it very claustrophobic. The staff are particularly rude and controlling compared with the much nicer staff in terenure aldi. The assistant left more than ten people waiting in the que to chat in his own language to a friend. I didn't have a coin for the trolley so I had to put my bail of peat bricketts onto the convarebelt at which point the assistant began to become very angry with me and took along time to put on his rubber gloves before handling the peat. Peat is not coaland dose not leave a mark on your hands. For this reason I will not be going back to this store a good again.,Aldi
84,This Aldi is an ok location to go to in the evening but the traffic can be especially bad here at rush hour or on weekends. I visit Aldi in other locations often but this was my first visit to the one in Sandyford. They had most of the products I wanted however the store is quite old / grubby. It could do with being refurbished because it just felt dark and dingy. I'll probably just wait and go to my usual store in future instead of stopping there again.,Aldi
85,"Great prices as usual, friendly staff members. A bit outdated store, renovation needed.",Aldi
86,Always great and I drive the extra 10 minutes past all the other shops for the quality and  value.  However I don't love the layout as much as the other stores and is smaller,Aldi
87,Not that much selection for Asian food here. Love the vegetable and dairy sections. Lots of frozen stuff to select from as well. Best for buying in bulk.,Aldi
88,"Aldi is always fine for food and prices are good, however I was very disappointed to find out that they were disposing a load of meat (maybe other stuff  too) to trash, even though today was the date on the package. It's such a waste of food. It should be given to charities, if not for human consumption, for animal feed. An animal died for that meat...and then it's chucked in the bin. Terrible. Or is the info wrong?   Aldi, I think you definitely can do better here! Let's not be wasteful. For food I'd score 3, for prices I'd score 5, but for wastage I'd score 0

Express check out / machines in Aldi and Lidl would be good. Finally I wish the plants in the stores were watered. Then they die, it's more wastage.",Aldi
89,"Nice and organized, with Lots of vegan options 👌🏼. Fresh fruits and vegetables 😋 and the staff are amazing and really helpful 👏🏼 …",Aldi
90,"Great Aldi, have shopped there from day 1. Very friendly and helpful staff, many of them who have been there for years. Easy in & out free parking.",Aldi

95,Love there special offers and they really have great Candles 🕯 ✨ And Assorted items 😀 Awsome …,Aldi
96,"They have food products and other homestuff products at cheap affordable prices.

They do not have everything though.",Aldi
97,"Compared to other branches, this store was really badly laid out and just seems to be very untidy.",Aldi
98,"I just got served by a guy who had no face mask on and he started rubbing his nose before scanning my items, won't go back there again. 🤢 …",Aldi
99,Love Aldi' baby section. They have a great baby food section with snacks and fruit purées.  Their range of baby wipes is also excellent and much cheaper than brand names.,Aldi
100,"Coming from the direction of lower Kilmacud road, the entrance to the car park was easily missed. Drove around to the back of the block thinking it might be around there. Drove back around from the direction of the beacon hotel and then found the entrance",Aldi
101,"Laid out in the same fashion as all Aldi stores are laid out. After 5 on a weekday, you can't get a basket for love nor money. The after work crowd swarm the place.
Best bring a shopping bag as your basket as unlike other surpermarkets, the security won't give you stink about it. Low prices as expected with the trade off being a limited selection with just the essentials. 5 minutes from the nearby Stillorgan Luas stop.",Aldi
102,"Love Aldis range of products. I shop in Tescos,Dunnes,Lidl and Dealz too but,there are certain products like whole grain rice,yogurts and fruit that are better quality and value for money in Aldi.",Aldi
103,"Tried 2 other Aldi stores and failed to get what I was looking for, but I got a petrol hedge trimmers in Blackrock, one of the guys went and got me a trolley and the item I got was very good value, did not stop me spending another 100 euro in the shop!",Aldi
104,I did like the visit but I still had to visit dunnes so wasn't really saving on,Aldi
105,"Lowest grocery prices.
Super fast cashiers.
90 mins free car parking.

Sometimes they are low on stock with some items.",Aldi
106,The usual for an aldi shop maybe a bit small but great value regularly shop here depending on time shelves can be a bit short of stock due to size of store and the fact that it busy,Aldi

Staff is quite nice",Aldi

114,"Great shop love the different products.  They have a great range of gluten free items , much cheaper than the well known ones . Cheers to Aldi 👌 …",Aldi
115,Great fully stocked Aldi offering all of their product lines. Has bike racks and is across the road from an equally as good Lidl.,Aldi
116,Very good and reasonably priced. Many times they surprise us with rarely found stuffs at grocery store.,Aldi
117,"It's my local aldi store, it's a great store for bargains shelves and freezers are always well stocked. Staff are friendly and very helpful. It's a very well kept store",Aldi
118,"I decided that some of the other shops owned by these two groups, Lidl and Aldi, were bettet laid out and better stocked. The stsfg were more pleasant than in some shops.",Aldi
119,Used to shop here quite often but it is hard to find an available basket recently. There are piles of empty cardboard boxes in the aisles so those can be used as an alternative.,Aldi
120,Great well stocked dunnes. You might need to park underground. Plenty of good furniture shops too.,Aldi
121,Value for money. But the shop is not organised properly and products & its arrangements are not appealing,Aldi
122,"Staff don't wear masks
Don't go there unless you want to get sick.
No regard for customers",Aldi
123,A bunch of freezers were totally empty but still a very good selection of products,Aldi
124,Shops meat dept displays are a health hazard they require urgent deep clean and also new shop manager .john cassidy.in sandyford,Aldi
125,Good departmental store with reasonable price,Aldi
126,Nice plants and really cheap compost. Food still the same.. +++,Aldi
127,Nice grocery store but Sandford located store is not so big hence have some limited options. You can also check Tesco in dundrum or dunnes store which is 15 mins walk from Aldi's.,Aldi

129,Good customer service and parking. Not crowded most of the times.,Aldi

141,"Well laid out Aldi,with friendly staff.Wine selection not great!",Aldi
142,There's not much more to say than its Aldi. If you are not familiar with Aldi it is something you can get good quality reasonably priced non brand name foods,Aldi
143,Aldi shop so clean and easy to get around. The staff are very friendly.,Aldi
144,"Quite often veg & fruit section is out of stock, which is really frustrating when you're trying to pick up some groceries on your way home from work and you end up going to another store cause there was no more lettuce or another basic stuff wasn't just there...",Aldi
145,Very nice place for shopping.,Aldi

519,Usual Aldi shop,Aldi
1,"Aldi Mulhuddart is located just off the main street of the village. It essentially serves the locals and probably motorists that stop by the Circle K just beside it to grab some essentials before embarking on their journey.
The staff are helpful in assisting the customers to locate items in the store.
It is always furnished with most household groceries needs displayed at affordable prices.
I recommend a visit to the store.",Aldi
2,"Great produce, easy to navigate around the store and the staff are very helpful.",Aldi
3,I love that they have trolleys for baby + toddler/child so you can shop with your family. Great variety of vegs and product of the Super 6 offer are fresh. Nappies and cotton pads for babies are excellent quality.,Aldi
4,Hard working staff need bit training in English and customer service,Aldi
5,Standard also experience. Not much different here. Getting in and out can be manic with traffic being a bit bananas during rush hour or first thing in the morning with school commuters,Aldi
6,"A place for grocery shopping. Nice range of wines, fruit (great golden kiwi), good Gluten free products, surprisingly good cosmetics",Aldi
7,Never again staff have a habit of short changing you,Aldi
8,Short changed and till operator made me wait to check the cameras very embarrassing,Aldi
9,"I got some fruit ( pomegranate) and they are completely rotten inside. It happens with their garlic and onions. Also I got a lime from the basket of limes, was told at the till they only sell organic limes in packs of 3. I asked if he was just going to throw out the loose one and he said yes. Why not just give the loose fruit to people rather than wasting it and throwing it out? That’s crazy to me .. what a bad way to run your store. Never coming back!",Aldi
10,Could be better with security as they always follow me but after I talked to management they stopped on the 2nd chat with management.,Aldi
11,"Aldi mulhuddart handy on outskirts of our village, good parking free , disabilities parking aswell as mother and baby parking . wheelchair Access, bus stop outside , chemist next door. Beside garage and cafe. Anything you need in food shopping and a selection of garden plants . Good bargains in the middle isle's. Staff are helpful and friendly ,all your shopping under one roof",Aldi
12,"Offers a fast and efficient service, with friendly helpful staff. Competitive pricing and always pretty reasonably well stocked store offering an alternative to Blanchardstown Centre😉🛒 …",Aldi
13,I love shopping here staff so nice..there's never trouble in the shop..its nice to shop in peace..in and out..parking is good too,Aldi
14,"Not as well organized as lidl..Way too much stock just threw anywhere in the middle aisle racks. Prices never match up with items on the shelf or racks..floor staff just storm around floors while shop is very busy, not sure if any accidents have happened yet...I wont shop here again , needs serious organized managerial skill..Not just a quick buck sell throw away plastic junk products.That dont last a year and then thrown into a skip..theres enough waste stock flung all over these Aldi shops.That if all was round up to sell off, would contribute to alot Irish problems.. Not just Making another member of the Irish Senate more €'s than he will ever spend",Aldi
15,Staff were very rude to us as it came to closing time. In my job I've stayed a hour after close to make sure our customers were satisfied but to be told to get out and that I couldn't finish the last isle of shopping was extremely unprofessional. Staff approached us in a angry demeanor. We understand people have families to go home to but the rudeness was unacceptable.,Aldi
16,"Very dirty in the shop, staff are unfriendly, especially security is very rude. Very disappointed today. After my visit today never back to this shop again.  Awful experience",Aldi
17,"I'd never really review food. So my fiancé is a vegetarian and I'd eat anything really. I have to say aldi's vegetarian section food is unbelievably tasty. I've had the katsu10/10
Sausage and bean 10/10
Asparagus 10/10
Sticky beef 10/10
Spicey chicken 10/10
All no meat and with amazing taste

Keep up the good work",Aldi
18,These German stores arrived and brought much needed competition into the grocery market..Nowadays however their as dear if not dearer than the rest.,Aldi
19,This is a well maintained and friendly store. Their goods are of a high quality and of course they are very reasonably priced. There are times when the shelves are been stocked and this results in some items missing from the shelves. If they stocked outside of opening hours then I would give 5 stars.,Aldi
20,It's good,Aldi
21,"The shop is  clean and well stocked,  staff do not look happy, rude at times , at the checkout they never say please, when they tell you your bill 20.50 please, 160.55 please Instead its 10.50, 160.55 no manners, I feel sorry for older people who shop there if they are not quick enough to pack the checkout operator wont help you for sure , dreadful customer service in this store",Aldi
22,Very safe shop 😅 …,Aldi
23,Used to be a good place for shopping the last few months not very reliable on stock!!,Aldi
24,Difficult to move around and maintain social distancing as there trolleys everywhere as staff were restocking shelves. Also feel they had too many people in the shop at once.,Aldi
25,"Nice amount if goods available here. Like with Lidl, popular brands may be expensive here. Could spend a while waiting in the queue though. Recently I found that I product that I would like to buy weekly was either not being sold anymore or had not been restocked. Not much staff floating around or at the till in general. Good price though and at a good location.",Aldi
26,Shelf's were full today depending on the day you go sometime they aren't fully stocked with everything. Staff friendly and opened tills as they needed them. Would be nice though if they had self service tills for ppl just picking up a few items I've lost count of the times I've let ppl jump in front of me cause they only have a few things in their hands!,Aldi
27,Went into this store today @10.05. Was looking to buy one of the specials that went on sale when store opened at 10am. On seeing the rack was empty but the price sticker was there I asked a member of staff who was working on the floor if the product was already sold or if there was stock out back. He told me he wouldn't have a clue.At the best of times I find the staff rude and shopping is usually flung at you but that does it. Customer service is brutal. I think I'll go back to Tesco.,Aldi
28,They changed their closing date due to neighbor complaining. Unbelievable. Always a lot of empty shelves with no staff put any stock back on time. Some staff has no manner. No greetings. No smile. Compare to other aldi. Much Lower standards.,Aldi
29,A super store serving a huge area with more new housing than most places. It was very busy on the dayi visited.extreme good value and top quality on everything they sell . The staff were civil and pleasent--seemed to be happy to be working there.,Aldi
30,"The guy on the till was dreadful. We've all picked the wrong queue at times but this was terrible.  Other queues were moving much faster, and at times with people with bigger shopping loads. With my girls with me and the till area being overloaded with empty baskets and stock, moving tills wasn't possible. I usually prefer Aldi but I'll be avoiding this branch from now on...",Aldi
31,"ALDI has brought down prices of groceries in the area since the store was opened. The other shops in the area now offer healthy competition in terms of quality and price. Easy access to the local community, free parking space,  good shelf displays and relevant products. Thanks ALDI for making life easier for the community.",Aldi
32,"This is a great shop, but how can they bar shop lifters and still let people in without masks, I know the staff should not have to confront these ignorant disease spreading imbeciles, but they are going in everyday not always the same people, the law is being broken and blanchardstown mulhuddart is the highest infected areas in Ireland  what an honour",Aldi
33,Really good store but almost all fresh vegetables were gone on a Sunday evening around 4pm. It isn’t the biggest store ever but the value is unrivaled. The fresh fish is particularly good.,Aldi
34,"A bit chaotic, lack of personal (otherwise very nice and helpful).
But if you have enough spare time, you'll be able to find nice ""surprises"" such as grocery offers and even baby toys. For someone who appreciates their products it worth to give it a try! I myself am ""dependent"" of some of Aldi Stores' products😊 …",Aldi
35,"It's my usual place for the shopping. It's well in general, despite not having fresh made bread is a pity. I usually go to other supermarkets just to be able to buy bread. For the rest, nice and helpful staff.",Aldi
36,"Super friendly staff in a very well stocked Aldi Supermarket. The layout is typical Aldi style, so you find the product you are looking for straight away, or search for ages and feel your hair turning grey in the meanwhile. At the end, you basket will be full and you leave the shop, after you survived the waiting time at the till ;)",Aldi
37,"Great Shop ,Staff Are lonely and such a brilliant Selection of Products,
And on the plus side it's only a couple of minutes from me .😊 …",Aldi
38,"Great value staples and body careitems. Often find great value specials, todays was large xmas sized boxes /tubs of Celebrations for 3.99e. Handy for gifts.",Aldi
39,"The main reason is pricing is always good
And friendly staff no delays at the tills the quality of their household goods and tools
Are tops with with a 3 year warranty that's why I give them 5 stars",Aldi
40,"Was in Aldi mulhuddart today very bad social distancing in the store especially at the check out people standing behind me had to tell one woman to back off she was to close, girl on the check out did nothing about it and security guard just standing around watching people not social distancing 🤷 very bad customer service there not following the covid rules .",Aldi
41,Love Aldi...only negative is they change their suppliers so just when your loving for example their seeded bread it changes completely and you feel cheated 😣 this goes for lots of products. Also if you are not happy with an item say for instance i found blood on a tissue in my packet of tissues... i had used the 1st one & went to take a second...yuk yuk yuk there it was....they are unconcerned dont offer any come back as in have it tested etc they just offer you a refund...this i dont like BIG TIME. Big positive though is value for money & quality of items...you just can't beat that!!,Aldi
42,Very good didn't sell everything that Aldi sells in Dublin Town but good value for money,Aldi
43,Great parking service,Aldi
44,"It's location is really handy for me. They could do with an express check-out, as I mostly only have a couple of items, and spend double the time queuing to pay for the shopping. It's a pity its only open until 9 during the week. ( the rest of Aldi's are open till 10pm) Also, it hasn't a bakery like some of the other Aldi's. It usually sells out of stock thats in the Special Buys weekly offers really quick. The Super 6 meat deals and fruit/veg are nearly always sold out if you go in the evening after 6pm, and most evenings after 8pm the shelves will be empty of the essentials like milk and bread etc.",Aldi
45,Love the new layout and a bit of an upgrade. I have not been to this particular stood in a while where I use to be a regular. I can always find what I want and the staff are always helpful and friendly,Aldi
46,"Brilliant as always
Just that the plants outside could do with a bit more looking after as they ALWAYS do be half dead and throw up beside the trolley bay not a good spot for selling them",Aldi
47,I like Aldi & they have good value for money. But the girl that was serving at till 2 was all but throwing the items at you and she couldn't wait for you to move on she started throwing the next customer's shopping at me as well...,Aldi
48,"How was Aldi, you ask? It was like the night of the living dead. This shop is normally ok but empty shelves, combined with aggressive shoppers makes for an extremely unpleasant experience. It's not Aldi's fault directly, but they should have security more present and more interactive. I've never seen them intervene in any situation. Ever.",Aldi
49,"Handicap parking should be facing the entrance
Staff need to be more pleasant
Specials should be on there own, current layout makes it impossible to do normal shop when big specials on
A much needed addition to Blanchardstown with 3 lidl here",Aldi
50,Lovely staff nice choice of food,Aldi
51,Nice friendly place...products have great quality and very low price. Staff members always provide great service.,Aldi
52,"Great shop,clean,great availability and offers.Staff and security always friendly and professional.Plenty of carparking also.Great produce section,always can get what I want here.",Aldi
53,Great but more better if use start deliver to homes lovely food great prices but for people no cars sure do deliver,Aldi
54,I just experienced being in Aldi in Mulhuddart village and it was so good. Food and all types of stuff you find in all supermarkets are in Aldi in Mulhuddart. Awesome. You need to experience this for yourself. Easiest 5 star review ever. Keep an eye out for my Lidl Tyrellstown review peeps,Aldi
55,I wished to find out if Aldi Mulhuddart had Ground Almonds in stock today as there was none there on Sunday last 29th Nov. Firstly there is no direct number available to customers or to the customer service agent that I got through to on a 1800 number therefore no way of checking. I consider this a very unhelpful system.,Aldi
56,One of the best supermarkets in Ireland for budget friendly shopping,Aldi
57,Nice big store great selection of food.,Aldi
58,Love the variety of food Aldi has to offer. Great offers every week. Their meat and fresh veg is of a very high standard.,Aldi
59,Aldi is great value for the price you pay  But this store is really cold. Ensure to wear a really good Jacket and pants! No shorts or you will freeze!,Aldi
60,The staff are very helpful and friendly 🙂🙂🙂🙂 the shop very clean and tidy if u can't find an item yourself just ask the staff & the always put their hand on it 100% …,Aldi
61,Staff friendly and helpful. Great range of products reasonably priced.,Aldi
62,"Great experience excellent service 👍 Excellent 👌 God 🙏💖🙏 bless everyone
My good people 🙏💯💫🌻🙏
Super charger for me 🤗 …",Aldi
63,Poor location. Staff tend to be unfriendly even by aldi standards. The store itself is pleasant enough but is very average when compared to the clonee aldi which is better laid out and has a larger selection of goods.,Aldi
64,Kettle Bells sold out in seconds. Customer quotas should have been implemented. Managed to get one in another outlet but it was a scramble to do so.,Aldi
65,The management of this store should seriously look into health and safety as few times I found food on shelves that gone off/expired. Not clean comparing to other Aldi stores. Polite staff tho.,Aldi
66,"Aldi is the bees knees
Got great seeds from here
Altough the aldi in clonee has left expired meat on the shelf a few times
Pain in the arse for me to return cause i aint got no wheels

Hey aldi sort your food out a bit better!

Other than that staff at clonee branch are all super friendly and helpful.",Aldi

68,"Who doesn't like Aldi! Great shop fantastic food selection with great weekly offers/deals  excellent baby range this week very well priced!! Great to see the bigger shop chains getting a kick up the backside from Aldi, for there ripoff over pricing. Fair play Aldi!!",Aldi
69,"Staff are brilliant  here, my favourite  Aldi.",Aldi
70,Went to get vegetables. They have fresh vegetables and some useful items in Super 6. Staff were helpful and those at tills are quick.,Aldi
71,"Lady cashier who served me was extremely rude, started laughing at me and making fun of me with the next customer behind me as I walked away to pack up my items could hear them slagging me off as I stood behind them packing my items up never been so embarrassed in all my life I shop here regularly but won’t be anymore!!",Aldi

1,"Nice little Lidl has ALOT but slightly on the small side. BREAD, MILK  ALCOHOL, VEG, READY MEALS, SWEETS, CAKES, CARDS, TOYS TOILETRIES ETC really nice staff just giving 4 stars because I know from being in others it's a little small",Aldi
2,"Aldi is fab! Loads of value and fresh choice foods every day. The middle isle section is fantastic with something for everyone from gardening to D.I.Y ,  loads for kiddies , clothes and beauty 😍
Can't get enough love it! 💕 …",Aldi
3,Great shop with great sloths,Aldi
4,"Aldi is our preferred weekly grocery destination due to its diverse product offerings, including cutlery, toys, sheets, gardening tools, and more. Their pricing is more competitive compared to Tesco and Lidl, while maintaining a consistent level of quality. Highly recommend Aldi for your grocery needs.",Aldi
5,Alright but stores are very untidy and hard to find goods. The special offers are hard to find as everything is thrown into the centre isles.,Aldi
6,"I shop at Aldi weekly and generally don’t have much to complain about but lately prices are increasing a lot, food is frequently found to be nearly out of date (or gone) and you have to be so careful with fruits in packages as some are rotten..then today a very rude member of staff (lady with blond, short hair) refused to let my potty training 3 year old into the toilets! You need to have better facilities available for very young, older and pregnant customers, it’s not right.",Aldi
7,"The prices are a bit lower than average. At times the shop looks untidy. Yet there are good deals, so it's worth checking out. In particular I like Gouda and Smoked cheese slices here, tasty and cheap.",Aldi
8,"Good shop. Like it.
This product is cheaper than in other shops.",Aldi
9,Always nice and fresh products,Aldi
10,"I find staff are very nice to there customers and if look for something just ask staff if they have inn, also find there food lovely even dry roast peanuts they are my favorite, also wish make big packets of the h hoops bigger and more in the packet, all should have seafood stir fry in the shop too because myself hubby kids we love stir fry and hope the store do that for everyone who shops in aldl store  all over the country in Ireland and overseas too, so get this message can you reply BK to me Therese McCabe monastery grove enniskerry co Wicklow live in number 48 and hope write BK to me by post, also sent this letter on line do get voucher aldl Bray from u many thanks hope hear from you, Mrs Therese McCabe enniskerry, enjoy the weekend and enjoy the weather",Aldi
11,"Friendly staff, good produce, needs to stock more gluten free and dairy free products!",Aldi
12,Really good selection of food and such. Prices are really amazing. Still cheaper than most cept on bread. Still great Fish Fingers,Aldi
13,"I typically only go here for the middle aisle items and then I might throw in a few extras items. There are bargains to be had!

My main gripe is with the typically overly long checkout queues. I have never seen all the checkouts open at the same time.",Aldi
14,"This is about this coolest place to shop at in Bray, Ireland.",Aldi
15,"Nice shop helpful staff but low rating is regard to the number people they are letting into the shop during level 5 restrictions. With
8000+ daily cases the store thinks it's safe to have near 100+ people in the store. You need to adjust number people go into a store vs what level we are at. 100 around you while 8000+ causes daily are walking around you.",Aldi
16,"All good, clean, well stocked, friendly staff, but need to sort the checkouts , an express or self service possibly card only would be a great time saver .",Aldi
17,"I'd just like to say a huge thank you to Marius on till number 5 for his extremely helpful and lovely manners, we had 5 trolley loads and it didn't phase him in the least.  Apologies to all the other customers at that time, thank you for your patience but it was for a good cause!",Aldi
18,"Good for value for money; but for nothing else at all, in my opinion. Shopping here for me is just pure chore. I'm ,economically speaking, poor but I prefer to shop in Super Value, and there I get a positive buzz and better value, both in quality & price! Yes it means selecting items with near sell by dates expired but even that searching makes for shopping fun.",Aldi
19,Never going to shop in this place again don't know what the policy is on use of bathroom but came across a very rude member of staff said in a rude manner to me toilet not here for public as a person with a couple of medical issues and needed to go to the bathroom I found this very negative and very unhelpful for a big store here in Ireland had to go down to Tesco's to use the bathroom and I will be shopping they're from now on very disappointed in this branch of Aldi's,Aldi
20,"One very rude and confrontational female deputy manager has turned me off aldi bray.
Called adli customer service to log complaint,  many months have passed without reply.
Other staff members I have engaged with since the store opened are friendly, polite and efficient.

STILL NO REPLY FROM ALDI CUSTOMER SERVICE.",Aldi
21,Aldi local to my home. Very popular excellent value.,Aldi
22,"I do my weekly shopping here and find everything I need. Options for vegetarian substitute foods, loads of vegetables and fruit and great prices. Sunday's loads of products are sold out so wouldn't recommend going then. Staff are very helpful and keep the shop tidy and easy to find everything.",Aldi
23,"I'm disgusted with a male member of staff, my elderly mother was shopping there in the bray store on the 8TH JULY an was caught short of needing to pee, she has a hernia that pushes on her bladder and was refused entry into use your toilets, she was embarrassed in having to ask in the first place, but then to be told in front of other customers that toilets are for STAFF ONLY!! she had to leave her shopping in her trolley along with her bags in the store and get a lift off somebody home to use her toilet, she was in agonising pain and afraid she wouldn't make it!! To the AREA MANAGER yous need to look at policies and procedures for pregnant, elderly women in using the toilet while in your store",Aldi
24,Ok .so we know Aldi's is cheaper and sometimes the middle aisles have good bargains. But the trolley dash at the checkout. Do we really need to be like packie Bonner⛹️🤾🤸 . I'm not getting the food for free. …,Aldi
25,"Very short dates on fresh meats,trifles cooked ham and sausages. I came across 4 packs of raw beef out of date by 3+4 days. Stock levels very low, and without a quite a few basics. Person on checkout very unfriendly and abrupt. Aldi has certainly lost its appeal.",Aldi
26,"Small Aldi, good for Groceries but other Aldi items are minimal. The Off Licence section is just for name sake....very few items only.",Aldi
27,Just back from aldi I go few times a week love the specials of fruit and veg it's great help meat prices have risen but can still shop in a budget and get good quality food .always lovely service from staff helpful and friendly,Aldi
28,Accessible and easy to get around. Small though when store gets busy so can feel crowded. Having said that Aldi are very proactive opening extra tills when needed.,Aldi
29,Although there can be a long line to get in mostly between 10am to 5pm after that it's okay to walk in and out without queuing in long lines. Well stocked now with covid19 so plenty to buy without waiting for restocking.,Aldi
30,My shop of choice. Why pay more? The stuff is good and costs a fraction of Dunnes price. Improved choice of ingredients too and healthy ready meals. Thumbs up!,Aldi
31,"Store lovely but just had the rudest male cashier who would not even tell me the total bill after me asking twice because he was too busy trying to get his till closed so he could leave for break. Threw my change on counter had to take my own reciept because this young guy was busy talking to the girl at the other till. Got out to car eggs were broken went back in told him and his reply was ""AND"". I said i will swap them then yeah. Will defo not be back again. Will go to my usual greystones branch where they are alot friendlier.",Aldi
32,"Aldi, is ok if you are looking for a special offer they have in store, not great for a weekly shop as prices have started to creep up.  Staff are  going around up to their eyes doing other stuff, not a great shop",Aldi
33,Aldi sells good quality food. But this particular aldi in Bray always seems to be crowded. You cannot run in and run out quickly unless it's early morning or late evening.,Aldi
34,Congratulations to all the Managerment and Team in Aldi Store 4/6/2019 the store is Clean the food marked well. You can get everything in this store. Thank you Team. I am Scoring the Aldi Store Five Stars.,Aldi
35,Great value and choice my only problem was they didn't have diet coke which I prefer so had to go elsewhere for this,Aldi
36,Just got great value in a toaster (12.99) and a soup maker (39.99) today both with a 3 yr guarantee!,Aldi
37,"Cheaters! This guys are cheating with price! Just been in a store and few articles said one price but later notice the other price on receip: Ladies dressing gown shown price 12.99 actuall price 16.99, beef minace meet shown price 1.99 actuall price 3.49, 6 large egs shown price 1.19 and actual price 1.99.

40,"Same as all Aldis, great value, and the staff are pleasant! Can't understand why anyone would go elsewhere!",Aldi

49,Discount supermarket! Easy layout to follow and good prices. Never any shortage of places to park. And queues at tills are never too long.,Aldi

52,"Always a nice shopping experience, well stocked, clean and very friendly staff.",Aldi

57,"ALDI in Boughall Rd Bray is a huge supermarket which follows other ALDI patterns of good food at reasonable price and a bigger variety than its competitor LIDL.  It is cheaper than Centra, Supervalue or Mace.  Clothes are cheap but lower-end range in quality.",Aldi

382,"HAS everything you need, good prices and acacias",Aldi
383,Quite a practical store. There is everything you need and good prices.,Aldi
384,"There are everyday shopping products at a competitive price. The establishment has a large parking lot. I recommend paying with a card, many of their products cost 0.49 or 0.69... When paying, they do not usually return the change. I have been shopping in the store for three weeks and it is something that I have been able to verify. What's more, on the last day I asked politely and the cashier told me that they had bad change, when he could clearly see that his cash register was overflowing with cents and coins. A way to make the client lose money weekly.",Aldi
385,This supermarket is very small like all others in Ireland but offers very low prices on its basic basket products. You will find local products and you can save a lot by doing your weekly shopping.,Aldi
386,"When I was in Ireland for language week, I lived near this Aldi's. To me it seemed like a regular Aldi. The staff was friendly like every person in Ireland.

During my school trip to Ireland, I lived near this Aldi. To me it seemed like a normal Aldi. The staff was friendly, like everyone in Ireland.",Aldi

2,Nice and clean but stock was a bit low on quite a few products,Aldi
3,"Same Ol'  ... Same Ol'.... but the wine selection and quality has improved!
Jan' 27th., 2023 Update, this store like a fine wine is improving with age.",Aldi
4,"Generally a very busy store so you would think they would look after customers by having checkouts open. I have witnessed people leaving down their baskets and walking out because of the long time spent on queues.  Besides that, good produce. Good prices. Basic layout and surroundings.  Staff work very hard.",Aldi
5,"Lovely staff in this store,  always welcoming.  Shop is clean and well stocked. Plenty of parking.   Only downside is that the shop does not open until 9am which means they loose out on the school run rush.",Aldi
6,"Wheelchair accessible, staff very helpful and polite, the new fridges are extremely difficult to open if you're a wheelchair user, but staff and customers are more than happy to help you.",Aldi
7,"Nice bright shop, which has benefited from a recent refit.
The staff are very friendly and helpful.
Aldi in Ashbourne is a store that offers great value for money. Car parking is free, however the layout of the car park could be a lot better, entry into and exit from the main parking area is a lot more awkward than is desirable.",Aldi
8,Excellent value….,Aldi
9,"Always treated with respect and friendliness.  Such lovely staff. Queues at checkouts can be a nuisance sometimes if you are in a hurry, but they work so hard, I forgive and and understand.",Aldi
10,"A really good shopping experience in Ashbourne. Friendly and helpful staff, always willing to help. Great prices.",Aldi
11,"Visited for the first time recently. Laid out well as most Aldi stores are. The main downside i see is that the exit from the carpark only has a single lane. I was waiting for a few minutes behind a car that wanted to turn right but wasn't able to get out with traffic. If there was a left turn only lane exiting, it would speed up the exit from the carpark.",Aldi
12,"Love this  Aldi.Parking is a dream,Inside is airy and comfortable,Staff can be a little bit distracted on their ear Mike thingy but  no big deal.10/10.",Aldi
13,"Great. Beautiful clean entrance. Everything in new coolers n very tidy appearance. Same check out service, speedy n friendly. Still value for money.",Aldi
14,Good choice of food but some of the newer shops have more and better choices,Aldi
15,"Love this place. The staff of friendly and helpful, they always have everything I need in stock. The quality of the products is brilliant, and at great prices. They are always happy to get product recommendations, and most of them appear on the shelves after a while.",Aldi
16,Use the store regularly and always clean and friendly staff.,Aldi
17,"Great Shop, very helpful staff. Their fresh fruit and veg are always high quality. The middle aisle is back so grab a bargain while you can.",Aldi
18,Cheaper for many products but often of poorer quality. Soft fruit liable to be over-ripe; cereals tend be partially roasted & get stuck in your teeth. But steaks & several other foods very good & we reduced our weekly food shop by average 10%.,Aldi
19,Staff are friendly and efficient. Stock levels vary especially with fruit/veg. Hand sanitisers readily available. Easy/plenty parking.,Aldi
20,This is an Aldi. Seems a bit smaller than some stores. You probably know what to expect. There's good quality food at reasonable prices. The staff seem very helpful. I even saw one of them help somebody pack their shopping.,Aldi
21,"I  don't  have a car just a shopping bag on wheels. I   have shopped here since they opened. I put  all my purchases in my trolley bag  and empty it at checkout. I did ask if that would be  ok to do  and was told by a Manager ""Do what you need to do"" so l am not treated like a thief for not using store trolley.",Aldi
22,"you ask people to take time to carry out a survey which really a way of further promoting the store ok i can understand that,  how ever when you get to the end of the survey you ask for detail like name /phone number / e-mail address and you are prompted to enter this detail if you don't with the assurance that this information will only be used for promotional purposes.

I don't mind that you post this information on the public web but i will not give you the opportunity to to gain my telephone number etc when it is clearly not required as you say to contact me,  as this can easily be done by e-mail, at the end of the day you ask for to much detail for a promotional gimmick .",Aldi
23,"Always well stocked, friendly till staff, quick service. Excellent value for money!",Aldi
24,"Always bring cash to this store, there are issues with card machines accepting payments. Happened a number of customers ahead of me in the que and myself. Revolt wouldn't work either. Cash is king 👑 …",Aldi
25,"Great store. Friendly staff and really good quality food. I used to buy Christmas food on Mark's & Spencer but lately the quality has been awful so about two years ago I switched to ALDI , just love it.",Aldi
26,"Everything you need stall very helpful
I like that there is plenty of space between the aisle.
And you will still have money in your wallet going home.",Aldi

34,Good clean shop.  Best beef and saves me 100s still the best shop. And great friendly staff.,Aldi
35,I do shop in ALDI but Ashbourne is not my local store. I was shopping there today and witnessed very poor customer service. A sales assistant(woman with blonde hair and a purple colour in it) was extremely rude to an older man when he placed his products on her till. She was serving a customer but had her till closed sign on the till which the man clearly did not see. I was so annoyed with her attitude and rudeness.,Aldi
36,"Lots of fresh products .
Lovely staff, always there to help",Aldi
37,"It good but have go there on a Sunday, If can get mad sometimes 😬 …",Aldi
38,"Great shop, it's clean and has more healthy options than Lidl , great value",Aldi
39,"Ask one of the  main staff workers about where is a product located in the store and was told we dont have it even though it was advirtised on this date. After finding it myself in store, i went looking for that member of staff to tell him that this is what i asked him about. His reply was sorry and looked as if he dosent give a toss..Very dissapointed..",Aldi

1,Just told this shop closed by a very rude worker of construction outside never shop there again turning customers aeay,Aldi
2,"Temporarily closed for renovations until May 16th!
A great shop and great staff otherwise!",Aldi
3,Is it just me or are the prices in aldi catching up with the rest. They need to start making more if their plastic recyclable ♻️ of course the customer will foot the bill. But I do enjoy a lot of Aldis products. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TRAINERS €14.99 REALLY NICE GRAB EM.,Aldi
4,"Nice shop, all required groceries are available, best prices as well. Would definitely recommend.",Aldi
5,"New Aldi store. Large, bright and well stocked. The  best and newest aldi store in South Dublin. Particularly good if you're looking for their Thursday deals that are often sold out quickly in other stores. They usually have them here for a few days.",Aldi
6,Never any issues. Food always good. staff always helpful,Aldi
7,"Clean and tidy, lovely staff and great choice of products",Aldi
8,"Great selection of products! But, stuff like this annoys me... all the plants are dead, and the store was unorganised and messy.",Aldi
9,It is very disappointed that there was no toffee or blueberries muffins in  stock on the shelf too long. So muffins are very popular at all time. Why taking too long not getting muffins from other company to keep stock on the shelf to keep costumer happy.,Aldi
10,Big store with a nice variety of options to buy.,Aldi
11,Young man on the checkout was very helpful 👌 …,Aldi
12,"Quick pit stop needed some Solar lights for back garden, pleasantly surprised how good they were.
I will definitely be back for more. 10/10 for the lights.",Aldi
13,Good groceries store with reasonable prices,Aldi
14,"I had the pleasure of visiting the Aldi store in Thomastown, Sallynoggin, and I must say that it was a great shopping experience. The first thing that caught my attention was how neat and organized the store was. Everything was in its proper place, and it was easy to navigate through the aisles. The shelves were well-stocked, and I found everything that I needed quickly and easily.

Another thing that impressed me about the Aldi store in Thomastown was the selection of toys on sale. There were plenty of options for children of all ages, and the prices were very reasonable. I ended up purchasing a few toys for my daughter and son, and they absolutely loved them. It's great to see a supermarket offering such a diverse range of products.

Finally, I have to commend the staff at the store who were all incredibly helpful and approachable, and they made my shopping experience all the more enjoyable. Whenever I had a question or needed assistance, they were more than happy to help.

Overall, I would highly recommend the store 10/10!",Aldi
15,They just need to sell lotto games,Aldi
16,Always scam with incorrect labels and prices,Aldi
17,"Regular customer who shops there weekly, car was clamped while i was actually in the store shopping!! I appealed the fine and they just refused to refund it even though i sent them copy of the receipt which showed same time as the clamping!! And also about 10 other receipts over last 2 months to demonstrate i shop there weekly. Very unethical nasty management.......will not be shopping there again. Is this how you treat your customers???",Aldi
18,"I got stuck in store with a large shop today....only to realise that my card was in my fun purse from last night, and my revolut card wasn't set up properly on my phone 🙃 one of the lovely Sallynoggin staff, Darren, saved the day.....(my brain was fried trying to figure out how dinner would be paid for....and all the lovely fresh veg I'd ""bought"" for soup!)....he had a genius plan of me transferring money to his revolut and he sorted my bill - thank you Darren - everyone ate in my house tonight because of you!!! 🤣🙄top job Aldi! Your Sallynoggin branch staff are fantastic",Aldi
19,Always has stock you need staff are helpful and friendly,Aldi
20,"This is one of the best Aldis around,. The staff are nice and there is a good range of products. The fruit and veg is really good. Only small criticism would be that there is not much space at the checkouts to pack your purchases into bags.",Aldi
21,Excellent customer service. Stock is always fresh on arrival shelves and fridges always filled! Staff are very welcoming also! Wish I could give more stars! Overall shopping experience was lovely! Thanks Aldi!,Aldi
22,"Friendly staff, good prices. We always find what we are looking for.",Aldi
23,"Thank you to the staff at Aldi Sallynoggin. I lost all my cards/driver licence in the store, everyone was so helpful & a very honest member of staff found my card holder the next day & we we're reunited. Once thank you all staff.",Aldi
24,Customer service at checkouts is pathetic.  As a person with mobility issues I had two items and had to queue behind someone with a trolley. No priority checkout for people with less than 10 items. No self scan tills or express checkout. Won't be going back. Competitors offer far better service.,Aldi
25,Lovely staff and always helpful I'm not a tall woman and can't reach a few items so ther very kind,Aldi
26,Always a nice experience. No,Aldi

30,Again. Good.quality food etc at.grat prices. The lowest but definitely.not the worst!,Aldi
31,Nice new store. Cheap prices. Easy to get a parking space. The only two things I don't like are that there is no bakery and that sometimes the quality of the product isn't brilliant. Overall great shop. Lots of transport options: 7a and 111 Dublin Bus routes just outside the shop and the 45a bus route two minutes away. Overall a good discount store.,Aldi
32,Very affordable price,Aldi
33,Friendly efficient staff and always good value,Aldi
34,Need to get a refund on a large item I bought a little while ago. They could not have made it any easier between ringing customer services and then to the manager of the sallynoggin branch. Absolutely fabulous customer service. Thanks guys. 100% happy.,Aldi
35,Good selection of quality products at competitive prices,Aldi
36,Quality food fresh vegetables the finest breads they do have a brilliant and amazing deals with alot of amazing things  wonderful deals on meat and vegetables and have to their staff are such wonderful and so very helpful there is absolutely nothing to much very very helpful and make u feel a bit better in all our stresses epespily when we have our children and grandchildren with can't appreciate that kind of services thank you so much Aldi cheers to all u petals x,Aldi
37,Great shop easy to get around and always seems to be well stocked. I got one of the famous firepits in this shop last year its still in the box in the shed. All the staff are very pleasant and helpful. A+++,Aldi
38,"Over 1 year now, doing my regular grocery shopping from Aldi. Very happy with prices, products, range, fresh produce and especially staff that services the Sallynogin branch 👏🏽 …",Aldi
39,Great prices. Ample parking clean,Aldi
40,We do our weekly shopping here. Has been a few years at this point. Stock is pretty reliable might be a odd week you can't get your usual item(s) but very rare.,Aldi
41,Regular weekly shopper who uses gym next store. Car park always empty and got clamped 1 minute after I left. Lost a weekly customer for life. Came back to 4 staff laughing at me with a clamp on my car after 45 minutes. 2 hour area,Aldi
42,"You can always get parking which is great. I got most of what I went in for but the selection of meat wasn't great. I had to make so many substitutions for the type of meat I needed for the meals I'm cooking this week. There was no diced / mini fillets of chicken, only a twin pack of chicken fillets, no chicken mince, no chicken thighs (not in a marinade), basically they had minced beef, steak and pork / bacon products - nothing  I needed. Only 1 type of bell pepper, multipack or otherwise so now I have 3 yellow peppers with no purpose. Overall it's an ok store because there were a lot of staff on tills for once but I wouldn't rush back.",Aldi
43,Best Aldi! Always well stocked and staff is friendly and helpful not like other supermarkets.,Aldi
44,"Great shop, their spirit selection is excellent and very reasonably priced.

Brilliant to have so close thoughout the pandemic, would have been lost without it. The staff are great, very friendly.",Aldi
45,"Excellent service, great prices, very friendly and helpful staff.",Aldi
46,Great variety and clean also reasonably priced on most products.,Aldi
47,Do not like going to shop it's cold and shelf's very untidy no display sequence,Aldi
48,"Great shop but I cannot get battery's or charger for new hedge trimmer, that I purchased????? Other wise good.",Aldi
49,"Not our local store, but we regularly use the Click and Collect service in the Sallynoggin branch, and it's brilliant!! I hope it gets extended to a lot more stores, even once life returns to normal.",Aldi
50,"Terrible place to shop, stand in queue for 20 minutes obviously due to covid, but there's local kids walking in through the exit only doors, slowing the entire process down. If you're going to enforce a limit to the number of people in the shop, maybe have someone keep an eye on the door.",Aldi
51,"Checkout staff wanted us to have  weekly shop scanned by her, put back into trolley, move trolley and contents away to a new packing area and only then to pack everything into bags. Needless to say we didn't do this mainly as nobody in queue behind us.  Will never go back there.",Aldi
52,"Very well organized even in Covid times. Excellent quality of fruit and veg, as well if you are an expath like me, you can find good quality dairy and meat products closer to what's found in the supermarkets on Europe Mainland - it is not as UKish like Tesco and Dunnes stores.",Aldi
53,Very reliable on prices and quality. Good service. To add to the above post. Still one of the best value shops around.,Aldi
54,Extremley friendly staff,Aldi
55,"Great to live close too and choice is great. But even though  its cheaper or price comparison is really good, it's also sneaking its prices up",Aldi
56,Quality Aldi. Faster on the tills than Lidl.,Aldi
57,"Quite at 10am, stock levels very good. Only issue is the number of tills they have open there is always queues at the tills as they font keep many open",Aldi
58,Great variety of food some cheaper than others,Aldi
59,"Dear Aldi,
This is my local Aldi and come here in for my weekly shopping and love it.However the past two weeks I have had quite unpleasant experiences. A week ago,I was at the check out and for some reason there was a call out for manager assistance was needed at that till. The manager Garett came out and rudely asked the store assistant what she needed and the lady replied she didn't need help. The manager continued to yell at her and asked not so nicely why she called her then and went back to the office .Everybody waiting at the till was taken back by the way he spoke to the employee. The store assistant did need help because she had to stop scanning and leave her post to get an item that had no barcode at the back of the store.
Today I came in for my usual shopping and Garrett was at the till. I was right behind another customer. When he was handing her the receipt he went onto explain if she completed a survey she could win 200Euro in voucher. When he handed me  my receipt though he handed me a rugby stamp to collect for the school. I told him I had no kids not did I know anyone in school but he still proceeded to give me the stamp. I took it and figured one of my coworkers at work might use. I was irritated and felt very stereotyped at that instance.I also wonder why I was not informed about the survey? Was it because of my ethnicity? How was it decided that I needed a stamp? Which criteria was used to determine so? ALDI you can do better this Garrett seriously need some lessons customer service and how to treat the employees.
Sincerely,
Soon to be ex Aldi customer",Aldi
60,The one of the better Aldi shops.,Aldi
61,Find that their wines are better than Lidl. Everything else is more or less equal but still find Aldi cheaper!!! One thing Lidl has is a bakery on site. Aldi should consider this.... Whats nicer than warm fresh bread!!!!!!,Aldi

63,"Dropped in for few items, very pleasant and friendly.",Aldi

65,"Lovely  shop, with very helpful  staff. One young Lady  went beyond the call of duty on my behalf  today, thanks.",Aldi
66,"Love Aldi's but wish that they had a fast track check out for 10 or less items. I would like if they continued some of the great food  stuff that was on sale for Christmas like scallops and black pudding, boned and stuffed duck. I find that restocking shelves should be done very early in the morning or quiet times during the day as trollies for restocking are very big and bulky and dangerous with small children around. Deirdre Torpey",Aldi
67,Recommend this store as its quite large and easy to get around found the staff very helpful and friendly.,Aldi

71,I absolutely love the store and Managers Graham and Craig and all the staff really give me great support. I am in a wheelchair as I have secondary progressive MS. Honestly before Aldi opened just down the street in Sallynoggin I couldn't afford to eat the food that I need to help me. Aldi sees to it that I do. I am so very happy that the ski wear will be in store on the 11th as I desperatly need all the ski wear to keep me warm and dry in the wheel chair. Seriously please tell the owner I thank him from the bottom of my heart. I am now a health wise happy shopper. If you had a Manager of the year' Graham is that Manager. Thanks to All staff in Aldi's Sallynoggin.,Aldi
72,Lots of tills open and well staffed.,Aldi
73,Excellent products at best value prices. Fruit and vegetables are among if not the best and freshest available. Their special buys are also great.,Aldi
74,"High quality food and wine for a fraction of the price. The steaks are tops, it's the prime cuts that used to be exported but Aldi now sell to the Irish. The cuts other well known retailers sold us for years was from the wrong end of the cow. Also the food cartel has been smashed since Aldi and lidl entered the Irish market.",Aldi
